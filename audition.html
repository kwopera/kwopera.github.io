<body><h1>Complete Preparation</h1>
<p>The secret of success in life: Prepare for opportunity when it comes. - Benjamin Disraeli</p>
<h2>Chapter One: Hurry Slowly</h2>
<p>There is nothing more glorious than discovering the world of music and, more specifically, operatic music. All of us can remember when we first fell in love with opera. In my own case, my love of this art form led me from being a pianist to becoming a coach and prompter. I feel fortunate to be able to work with those who have voices able to communicate the beauty, warmth, passion and challenge of opera to an audience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the world in which we live, an operatic voice can sometimes leave its possessor feeling frustrated rather than blessed. Dealing with the practicalities of life sometimes leaves us precious little time to pursue our art, The twenty-six or twenty-eight-year-old in any other field of endeavor is already climbing the corporate ladder; a singer is usually in the midst of intensive study. We may have to deal with friends and relative saying, &quot;When are you going to get a job?&quot; There is an assumption that an opera singer cannot make a living. The career entry singer must often work as a word processor, receptionist or proofreader, for what seems like an endless period of time. What you <em>do</em> is those things; what you <em>are</em> is an opera singer. </p>
<p>But there is light on the horizon for the young singer. Once upon a time, there were one or two people who would perhaps help a singer or two. The beginner today has a much better chance. There are many more organizations, universities, apprentice and summer programs which afford opportunities for the young performer. The Metropolitan Opera, for example, helps thousands of singers, not only as an institution, through its auditions and Young Artists program, but through many of the singers with successful careers who take the time to help, advise and support young talent. For many years, teachers taught at the schools from which they graduated and never went far from home. A gifted teacher in that setting can give you only a certain kind of expertise. More and more, we have great performers who teach and are able to communicate a level of knowledge that is not only valuable to the young singer, but which saves him from time-consuming musical misadventures and serious career mistakes.</p>
<p>Another wonderful change is the explosion of opera in the media. You see opera performances and concerts on public television. Commercials use opera to sell products. Got to the movies and notice all the films that have woven opera into their plots. </p>
<p>But even with all of the increased interest in this country, there are still not always enough openings for all the wonderful singers we have, and opera companies suffer a chronic lack of funds. So the aspiring opera singer needs special equipment in order to survive the rigors and challenge of an operatic career -- or more accurately, of <em>working toward</em> an operatic career. In comparison to getting the career, having a career may seem easy!</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware that from where you are now, having a career doesn&#39;t seem easy at all. Strangely enough, we don&#39;t realize that there is lots of room at the top; it just might be a little hard to get through the bottom. Still, I have yet to see somebody with real ability and the necessary personality traits who couldn&#39;t climb the ladder.</p>
<h3>The importance of Mental Health</h3>
<p>I believe one key is preparation, the preparation of your psyche as well as the music and voice. Given the necessary talent, of course, keeping on a healthy mental track is probably the straightest road to a successful singing career. Too many singers get lost along the way because of their inability to be psychologically well-balanced while attempting to maintain an unbalanced work life: being a humble student in the morning, able to take tons of criticism, and in the evening, a star worthy of an audience&#39;s rapt attention and a paycheck anywhere from $300 to $10,000. That kind of ego flexibility is not found in everyone. So it&#39;s one of the things for which you really have to plan and prepare. It&#39;s true, of course, that we all have to study; it&#39;s a privilege and challenge we enjoy our whole career. But being a <em>student</em> is a state of mind that we should enjoy for as long as appropriate and then move beyond. You can stop practicing to be students and start practicing to be professional singers -- young, vital, focused, energetic, serious young professionals. Being a student is not the same as studying. The ongoing process of studying and learning, solving problems, discovering answers, finding new powers inside yourself, are some of the biggest thrills a performer can have. </p>
<p>Some of the best work done by the artists I know is done when they are slightly obsessive and self-involved. This is not surprising, since putting yourself on the line makes singers extraordinarily vulnerable, and preparation takes a great deal of commitment. After all, you carry your instrument in your body. It goes where you go. And the two small muscles in the throat that are your voice are not reliable in the same way as a Steinway piano is. As a singer, you not only have to build your instrument, but also learn how to play it, care for it and fix it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying you need to be obsessive (well, maybe a little). But you need to be someone whose mental health is kept up either by a very good support system or by an ability to be well-balanced and see that problems are often in the opera <em>business</em> and not within yourself.</p>
<p>So start to ask yourself some questions. Where is your support system? Where does it come from? What are your vulnerabilities? How can you be truly strong and not just propped up by the kind of flattery that is so dear to our hearts? How can you get to a point where you are supported by the real security of knowing your craft and knowing what it is you have to offer?</p>
<h3>Your Career as a Business</h3>
<p>To look on the practical side, you have to be prepared to deal with the business part of your life while working toward a career. What will you do when you come to New York to study, if that is your goal? Have you prepared yourself to work at a job while you&#39;re learning? Do you know how to fund-raise for yourself? Singing is expensive, and you can&#39;t afford to be casual or cavalier about your training. Fantasies and illusions about moving to New York and becoming a star overnight are enjoyable, but basically unrealistic.</p>
<p>There are some important basics to learn. Find out which people are informative -- How to <em>network</em>, but not associate with people who are negative, non-supportive and gossipy. Learn the distinction between information and gossip. Learn it today. Information is something you can indulge in very freely, and gossip is something from which it would be best remove yourself. Almost everyone learns this the hard way. I found this out early in my career: I sat in a restaurant with a friend and gossiped about how awful our conductor was. We were astonished to learn later that his entire family and his manager had been sitting right behind us! Well, neither of us had those jobs very long. It had taken so much work to get that position, and I remember how quickly it was lost. You can make a habit of saying everything and anything <em>at home</em>. Tell your mother, your father, your sisters. Make it a rule that in your house you will say what you want to people who are related to you. But outside, do not indulge in the kind of thing that especially makes young people feel knowledgeable in this business: gossip and negative opinion.</p>
<h3>Coping with Rejection</h3>
<p>Opinion! Opinions make the discussion of opera and voices fascinating, and opinion has to be carefully distinguished from <em>fact</em>. If your coach says, &quot;You&#39;re singing flat,&quot; this needs to be taken into account. If a manager says, &quot;I don&#39;t think your voice is the right quality for the part,&quot; that&#39;s an opinion. Perhaps there is something in your voice that doesn&#39;t interest this person. While we don&#39;t feel terribly upset if we don&#39;t attract or interest every human being we meet, as singers, we can become very upset if every person in the musical world doesn&#39;t love our voice. It&#39;s truly a very vulnerable part of us.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to evaluate the source of opinions and facts. However, you must realize that not everybody is going to like your voice. That doesn&#39;t make your voice bad. Think of the opera singers you don&#39;t like who have achieved great fame and are not at all bothered by the fact that you don&#39;t like them! Some voices, after all, are wonderfully controversial. But the truth is, as singers grow, they restudy and change some opinions and strengthen others. Successful singers (and I&#39;m aware your definition of successful is someone who works all the time and doesn&#39;t have to sing in a restaurant) are still working on developing the perfect vocal technique. You can talk with most professional singers and hear long discussions on this subject. There really is no agreement in heaven. I thought everybody would <em>knew</em> when I started working with the great singers.</p>
<p>Before setting out to audition, it&#39;s worth it to sit down and realize that if someone adores your voice, that doesn&#39;t make your voice great. And if someone doesn&#39;t adore your voice, that doesn&#39;t make your voice second rate. It can be hurtful, but rejection is part of this business. If you can&#39;t come to terms with rejection and learn to deal with it, the creative arts aren&#39;t for you! Of course, having a good attitude is helpful. It&#39;s so interesting to meet the singers who think that music was created just so their voices could be exposed to the public. Then there are those singers who believe, &quot;Isn&#39;t it wonderful that I have a voice, because this music is so important and beautiful, I want to share it with everyone!&quot; I think that&#39;s the attitude that supports you and helps you develop the most. Focus on developing your technique, so that you can be as creative as the music you love requires. Be ready to grow every day.</p>
<h3>Know Yourself</h3>
<p>Another key to coping with rejection is knowledge about the realities of your voice, knowledge about your present level, where you should be, where you are, your goals. Singing at the Metropolitan Opera is a lofty, exciting and compelling objective, but perhaps your first goal should be acceptance into the studio of the best voice teacher you can find. Then try to win a small competition, and eventually graduate to a bigger one. This can lead to working in a small opera company. It&#39;s all a process, a very exciting process. </p>
<p>Analyze yourself. How well do you take direction? How well do you remember? How flexible is your voice? How fast do you learn? How quickly can you deal with what a conductor wants, especially if it&#39;s different from what you&#39;ve prepared? Those are skills that come from having security inside yourself. Security comes from the ability to deal with your instrument, from having a good technique and solid musical basic -- good teaching, good coaching, good preparation. </p>
<h3>Getting on the Right Road</h3>
<p>I would love to get those of you young artists who are reading this book to the wonderful place where you have all the opportunities to perform that you want. Since that&#39;s not achievable in a book, I can hopefully get you started on the right road, the road to complete preparation. If you get nothing else from reading this, I would like you to begin to understand what <em>complete</em> preparation entails, and to share with me the great excitement and satisfaction that it can bring you.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge that the temptation for me to qualify nearly every statement in this book was almost overwhelming. Let me just state here that nothing is true one hundred percent of the time; everything is true some percent of the time. I can&#39;t pretend to bring everything to the depths that I would wish. Those depths can only be achieved between a teacher and a singer, a coach and a singer, in private, one-on-one sessions. This book will in no way replace those relationships; however, if you get just one idea that brings you further along, I will be happy.</p>
<p>The great singers of the past have left a wonderful operatic world, and it&#39;s up to us to take that world a step further. Each decade, there is more musical integrity, more dramatic involvement,  more musical research and more operas to explore. There has never been a time when we needed singers more, to bring the world of opera into new dimensions and to preserve the kind of musical excellence that has grown in the last fifty years. We have truly had great conductors and singers who have shown the utmost respect, love and joy for the study of the music itself. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important rule I&#39;ve learned in my lifetime, and one of the things that made a great difference in the way I studied, is an Italian phrase left to us by Toscanini: il massimo di rigore, il massimo d&#39;espressione. That is, the combination of the maximum of correctness, exactness and excellence in study of the music and the maximum of expressiveness. To be merely correct is not enough. To be only expressive is not enough. It&#39;s the combination.</p>
<p>To take fear of exposure,  to take self-doubt and limited experience and try to feel like you have the right to communicate something important on the stage is very hard. We all know that it&#39;s hard. But you have to do it, nonetheless.</p>
<p>I said to a teacher once, &quot;Maestro, this is so difficult.&quot; He said, &quot;Then, we&#39;ll do it difficult.&quot; The fact of the matter is, you have to do it anyway. I hear so many students say, &quot;It&#39;s so difficult to really get into the character (or trill or sing low).&quot; Well, difficult or easy, you have to find a way.</p>
<p>We can teach ourselves almost anything. We can teach ourselves to enjoy being on the stage instead of being terrified. We learn what we practice, and if we constantly concentrate on being nervous, we surely will be. If we practice in our minds and in our bodies and in our self-talk the idea that, &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t wait till I get my chance to go out and perform,&quot; walking out onto the stage might seem like an opportunity rather than a barbaric penalty one has to pay for the desire to be a singer. (However, if after all this work, you find you&#39;re still a little nervous, that&#39;s okay. You can learn to work with it and turn it into an asset.)</p>
<p>In any case, walking out onto a stage, hopefully, is what you&#39;re going to be doing for the rest of your life. And the minute your foot hits the stage, you&#39;re &quot;on.&quot; That may be hard to realize, because most singers wait until they start singing to be &quot;on.&quot; It&#39;s important to build within yourself an idea that, yes, the stage is a place where I am <em>free</em> -- to imagine, to live, to create, to be, to sweep the audience with me. Sometimes, because our upbringing tells us to be quiet and keep our hands still and voice low, it&#39;s hard to get up on stage and be an &quot;exhibitionist.&quot; You don&#39;t have to rant and rave in life; you can still get up on stage and communicate whatever you want, be anything you want, as expansive and as charismatic as you can.</p>
<h3>Preparation - The Key</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to have a career is to be terrific. I&#39;m serious. I asked a young singer in a class what people were going to like about his voice in ten years. The class laughed self-consciously when he said, &quot;Beauty of tone.&quot; But that wasn&#39;t an egotistical statement. He thought it was the most important thing he had to offer. You each have something special. And if what you have is beauty of tone, work on the other things, but capitalize on that. Remember, we have three strong strands, like a braid to intertwine: voice, music and drama. Each one of these strands is important, and you may feel stronger in one area than the other. Enjoy your strengths, and work on building and developing your other strands. </p>
<p>While reading this book, keep in mind that a lot of great singers have broken the &quot;rules&quot;: the weight rules, the range rules, the repertoire rules, the height rules, the age rules, and so on. Don&#39;t limit yourselves. Use the book to give you something to think about, to start you on your way. But never forget that your way is an individual one, and it&#39;s a path only you will walk to your particular destination. Learn from others, but retain your individuality. Be kind to yourselves, be patient and most important, keep your eye on the goal of sharing the glorious music you&#39;re gifted enough to be able to sing. Make your study and auditions fun and joyful. For the moment, they&#39;re your main performance opportunity. </p>
<p>Hurry slowly. Lesson number one.</p>
<h2>Chapter Two: The Externals</h2>
<p>&quot;What difference does it make that I&#39;m forty pounds overweight, if I sing great?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, if you sing <em>great</em> it doesn&#39;t matter, in some theatres. If your voice is one of the wonders of the universe, if you&#39;ve spent twenty years singing in the biggest opera houses in the world, if you&#39;re the only person in the world who sings a certain repertoire or knows a particularly obscure role, it probably doesn&#39;t matter. Remember what I said about breaking the rules? The director of a large opera company promised to pay a singer who was just starting out $500 a performance if she lost fifty pounds. Many years later, this now-famous singer said to me, &quot;Now I weigh fifty pounds more, and they&#39;re paying me $5,000.&quot; But you have to sing great, great, great, great. If your voice is that phenomenal, close this book and relax.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, try to imagine that half your audience is deaf and the other half is blind. You, the opera singer, must reach both those who can only see and those who can only hear. Sometimes what we see <em>is</em> what we hear. People really do consider opera an audiovisual art.</p>
<p>Ask yourself - with so many excellent singers today and so much competition out there, why would you allow yourself any disadvantage, if it&#39;s a disadvantage you can control and turn into an advantage, or at least neutralize?</p>
<p>In a world where television/video is becoming a standard part of auditions and of opera, there&#39;s no way to avoid the fact that a singer&#39;s looks are important. Like it or not, externals count in audition and performance situations. It doesn&#39;t seem fair, and it isn&#39;t, but it is nonetheless so. And today, with so much social interaction in an opera company, the presentability of the singer as a person is important, offstage as well as on.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also true that what is suitable in a huge opera house is different from what is suitable in regional houses or in Europe. But in this book, I am dealing with the young singer who probably won&#39;t begin a career at La Scala, but does enter some competitions and apprenticeships, or sings in regional houses and perhaps does an audition tour in Europe. </p>
<h3>The Importance of Choice</h3>
<p>The hard thing to learn is, as you make your entrance in an audition, you can really be anything you want, as long as it&#39;s by choice. I <em>choose</em> to look like a poised, capable, experienced, dominating, strong person. I <em>choose</em> to look sweet and simple. Or I choose to look aloof or friendly.</p>
<p>I suppose it is possible for someone to wander out on stage having made no decisions as to what persona they wish to project, how they wish to dress, what repertoire they&#39;re really suited for, and be launched into an opera career, if they possess the voice of the century. But this book is not for the exceptions. Remember, you can be <em>exceptional</em>, and many of you reading this probably are, and, unfortunately, still have a very <em>ordinary</em> career course. If something marvelous happens to pluck you from obscurity the second you leave college, great! But if not, be ready to work, to prepare, to choose.</p>
<p>The definite no-no is the person who comes out on stage to sing looking like he or she really hates being there, hates singing, hates the procedure and wishes he or she had never seen the audience or heard the music. Anything else is forgivable - even making a mistake in the music. Suppose you forget the words, blow a line, crack on a note? It&#39;s possible, and heaven knows, it&#39;s happened to a thousand professional singers. So you&#39;re not perfect. But being afraid to allow your personality to glow, to be a part of the music, is not a good choice. We don&#39;t want to hire stone statues for opera. </p>
<p>Make sure that everything you wear or carry on stage is the result of a choice. No young person chooses with the experience of an older person, but the one advantage you have over an older, more experienced singer is your youth and your enthusiasm in auditioning for the first time. Deal with yourself and with you externals at an appropriate professional level. The kind of person who wanders out on stage not knowing what they&#39;re doing there doesn&#39;t make a good impression on their listeners. It&#39;s also not living up to your responsibilities as an artist.</p>
<h3>Your Strong Points</h3>
<p>Making the most of your strong points is probably one of the most important things a young singer can do, and seldom does. If you don&#39;t know how, you can ask people who can help you. There are books on clothes, on make-up and on make-overs. Use everything you need. Call your friends. Hire an expert. Remember, it is most important that the dress enhance the person, but not upstage you or the audition. It&#39;s like building a house in a natural setting - both the landscape and the house must be enhanced. Some singers put on a dress or a suit that&#39;s so terrific, it&#39;s all you see. Or the dress or suit is wonderful, but just doesn&#39;t belong on that person. </p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re dressed like the character you are auditioning for or not, as long as you&#39;re dressed in a way that looks as if you belong in a theater, not a kitchen or a gym. Auditioners can always see quality and care. We understand if somebody can&#39;t afford to shop in high-fashion stores, and that really doesn&#39;t matter, but thought, planning and choosing are all important.</p>
<p>Someone in your local dance studio, or an exercise teacher, can give advice about your walking and movement. It does seem like a long way from the edge of the stage to the piano, and there are an infinite number of ways to get there. Your entrance can have purpose, impact and look as though there is an affinity between the stage and you. (You also don&#39;t want to fall down!)</p>
<p>There is nothing like having a videotape made of yourself and, after about a week of terror, sitting down, perhaps with your teacher or a good friend, to really look at it <em>analytically</em>. You will find that a videotape shows you a great many things you do <em>well</em>. It shows that you don&#39;t look like a stone statue or that you are not constantly in motion. But it also may show that your walk or posture could be better, that your facial expression as you announce your name and your pieces could be more poised, your voice clearer, faster, slower, warmer. If you&#39;re in a situation where you don&#39;t have many teachers, at least the bimonthly use of a videotape gives a good record of your progress, gives you more confidence and shows that places that need work. </p>
<p>Women, you can always go to an expensive department store (but leave all your credit cards at home). Go with someone whose taste you respect. Try things on. Get an idea of the right style for you. Then head for the inexpensive districts and see if you can find a reasonable facsimile or have one made. Ask yourself, What is the image I want to project? Diva-ish? Pert? Sexy? Innocent? If possible, check the color of the curtain you&#39;ll be singing in front of, so you don&#39;t wear a dress that fades into the background because it&#39;s the same color. Keep your hair styled. If you need help with your make-up, get it.</p>
<p>Men, polish your shoes! Use shoe trees so the end of you shoes don&#39;t curl. Make sure you shave (or trim your beard). No wrinkles in the suit. A shirt with a comfortable collar that allows you to sing. These sound like nonsensical details, but they are important one. And these are details that, in preparing one&#39;s voice and getting to an audition, are sometimes forgotten - and often noticed by auditioners. Even if they&#39;re not noticed, attention to detail will make you feel cared for, special, polished and prepared. </p>
<h3>The Weight Controversy</h3>
<p>Back to the weight question. We all wish we were five pounds thinner, but if you&#39;re talking about fifty, get at it <em>before</em> you audition. Obviously, opinion about weight ranges may differ for a light lyric or a dramatic soprano, but you don&#39;t have to be overweight to sing, and you don&#39;t have to be overweight to have a big voice. Understand your build and your voice type and be realistic about your weight. It&#39;s not necessary to be a perfect size eight. Being thin-thin is not required. I am talking about an appropriate size for the role and the house where the opera is being performed. </p>
<p>Most regional houses want a package, a total of sound, style and look. Unless you have the fabulous gifts of Joan Sutherland, it will be difficult to be hired for <em>Fille du Regiment</em> or <em>La Traviata</em> if you&#39;re oversized. The days of the extra large Mimis are coming to an end. I&#39;ve chosen examples of women&#39;s voice types and roles, but, of course, the same is true for men. Excess weight will work against the aspiring Duke or Alfredo just as it will against the would-be Gilda or Violetta.</p>
<p>Externals really count. Remember, when you walk out on stage, we see you before we hear you. You haven&#39;t started to sing yet. Don&#39;t be counted out before you do.</p>
<h2>Chapter Three: Repertoire</h2>
<p>Now Let&#39;s talk about when you do start to sing. What <em>are</em> you going to sing?</p>
<p>It&#39;s helpful to take a long look at the total distance you will want to go in your career. It&#39;s one thing when you&#39;re twenty to say, &quot;If my career only lasts twenty years, it&#39;s okay.&quot; But young singers don&#39;t realize how soon forty comes and how much you may not want to give up singing at forty.</p>
<p>Try this. Write down your age and what you&#39;re singing now. Then write down what you see yourself singing in five years. Ten years. Fifteen years. Is there a progression there? If you are singing Wagner today and you&#39;re twenty-five years old, what are you going to be singing when you&#39;re fifty? If you aspire to be an Aida at forty and you&#39;re twenty-six now, you should perhaps be looking at Donizetti, Mozart, lyric Verdi now and let yourself grow into that more demanding repertoire. There should be reasonable room for growth and change. And if you&#39;re going to make a mistake, make one that will help you live a longer vocal life, not a short one. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s pretend that voices come in sizes, like gloves and shoes. I find the most common mistake is that a young voice, which is probably a size five or six or seven, goes into auditions singing size ten, eleven or twelve music. It&#39;s fun to try out the heavier repertoire occasionally, so if you&#39;re a lovely, light lyric soprano and you feel like it, sing Butterfly for twenty minutes one day, once! If you&#39;re twenty-two and you want to sing all those wonderful arias from <em>Aida</em> and <em>Il Trovatore</em>, go ahead and sing them once a year.</p>
<p>But the best way for you to grow in your repertoire is the way music itself grew. It started with Handel, Monteverdi, Pergolesi, Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. That&#39;s where you can start, too. Richard Strauss and Wagner came much later in the musical scheme. In your little schematic of what you should sing when, perhaps that later repertoire should come when your skills and your voice are really developed and formed. </p>
<p>When you look at the singers who are smart, you see that Mirella Freni, as an example, began by singing Adina, later moved into some of the Verdi/Puccini repertoire and is only now singing <em>Manon Lescaut</em> and <em>Il Trovatore</em>. She&#39;s still singing great. </p>
<h3>The Proper Repertoire</h3>
<p>For some reason, everyone wants to be three fachs bigger than they are. Perhaps part of this comes from the misconception that auditioners only want to hear big voices. The fact is, a beautifully resonant, well-projected voice of quality, expression and style is more important than size.</p>
<p>Size is a very misunderstood word in relation to voices. Opera singing is probably the only time when everybody thinks the best thing to do is to be big. The projection of your voice does matter. The size of your voice doesn&#39;t really matter, as long as you&#39;re in your appropriate repertoire. Your goal is ultimately to perform in a theater with an orchestra, so ask yourself, Who&#39;s going to sing Susanna and Don Ottavio if all we have are sopranos for <em>Aida</em> and tenors for <em>Turandot</em>?</p>
<p>Some singers feel that if they are too heavy physically - if they are, say, a Mimi in Brunhilde&#39;s body - that singing heavier repertoire will help them get roles. It generally doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Another common misconception comes from the singer in an &quot;overpopulated&quot; fach, for instance, the lyric soprano fach - Marguerite, Micaela - who feels that because there is so much competition for these roles, the solution is to move into Tosca and Salome. Wrong. The solution is to make what you do so special in your right repertoire that you will be hired. </p>
<p>Recently, a friend of mine from the Metropolitan Opera telephoned to tell me a great opportunity. She said a singer was needed to do a fantastic concert in Europe of Rossini arias. I thought to myself, Who is ready? Who has their pieces ready? I could think of only two people who were really prepared to perform a Rossini aria. And yet, there is a Rossini aria to fit almost everybody. When you begin to understand that the programs, the concerts, the operas themselves can&#39;t be put on without the singers, you begin to understand why sometimes the American singers, with all their great superiority of technique, sometimes lose out to European singers, who concentrate more on readying what is <em>appropriate</em>. Perhaps they are more practical in their approach. </p>
<h3>Too Much, Too Soon</h3>
<p>When a young singers goes into an audition and announces she is going to sing &quot;Pace, pace&quot; from <em>La Forza del Destino</em>, or he is going to sing King Philip&#39;s Monologue from <em>Don Carlo</em>, the reactions is almost always, &quot;Why have you chosen this?&quot; If you intend to sing the most difficult arias in the repertoire for audition, be sure it&#39;s an appropriate choice for you and that you&#39;re up to the challenge. </p>
<p>Those big arias are also full of little mysteries. There&#39;s a wonderful line from a Mario Lanza film, &quot;These arias don&#39;t give up their secrets easily.&quot; The young singer hasn&#39;t been studying long enough to flesh out these arias. For that reason, these pieces can serve you poorly. In auditions, sing arias that add to you right now, not ones that point up what you don&#39;t have yet. </p>
<p>And before you embark upon learning these huge arias, please bear one other thing in mind. Muscle memory is a very powerful thing. It&#39;s hard to change a physical habit (think what it would be like if you had to learn to walk another way). If you learn these pieces when you&#39;re young and not at the height of your vocal maturity, re-learning them later in life can be a difficult, frustrating and expensive process. So don&#39;t learn every famous aria in the anthology - please, I beg you. Otherwise, you&#39;re going to spend a lot of time undoing the mistakes in order to relearn the aria. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you are older, performing the more dramatic repertoire can be much more appropriate. First of all, the voice is mature enough to do so, and second, you usually have a stronger and more defined vocal technique, plus some stage experience to help you cope with keeping your voice in good shape while you are singing music with a high degree of emotional impact. Each singer is a very special case and must be dealt with on an individual basis. This approach sometimes can result in having a wonderful, if short, career. </p>
<p>You have heard that the opera houses in Europe are small so that it&#39;s easier to sing a heavier repertoire, but you can find yourself in a European house that is not very good acoustically, so it doesn&#39;t always make a difference that they&#39;re smaller. </p>
<p>Going out and tackling your biggest, hardest aria doesn&#39;t necessarily win you any extra points. Strangely enough, I&#39;ve seen competitions won by people who sang pieces that weren&#39;t very &quot;showy&quot;. &quot;O mio babbino caro&quot; from <em>Gianni Schicchi</em> or &quot;Steal me, sweet thief&quot; from <em>The Old Maid and the Thief</em> - uncomplicated, not long, but when extraordinarily well-sung by winner. You do want to show all the aspects of your voice, to demonstrate all your special abilities of range, color and technique. Those are the qualities that count, not only the difficulty of the piece. It&#39;s better to have too much - too much richness in your voice and a lengthy career are better than reading in the paper, &quot;Not quite up to the role of...&quot; That sort of thing is so easily avoided if one is judicious in choice of repertoire. </p>
<p>Having five arias that show your vocal and artistic range and are beautifully prepared means that you go into an audition feeling great. You have ten minutes to give them a lot of information about your voice. And since we acknowledge that very few singers are perfect, auditioners will also hear the imperfections. This is normal, and there really is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Be miserly in your repertoire, so that you can give it the preparation and attention it deserves. Repertoire is important; it&#39;s important to your longevity as a singer and to your vocal health, growth and artistic success.</p>
<h3>Choosing Repertoire</h3>
<p>Repertoire for study is one thing; repertoire for performance is another; repertoire to help you voice learn how to do certain things, your study piece, is still another. Ask yourself what you&#39;re learning from the piece you&#39;re singing. If you&#39;re not getting musical, dramatic or vocal knowledge out of the piece, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t sing it yet. </p>
<p>The song repertoire should definitely be part of your study repertoire. When preparing your music, remember, there are all kinds of auditions that are important: auditioning for a voice teacher or a coach, auditioning for a competition, auditioning to get one step higher on a rung. You don&#39;t always have to sing an aria to do it. Don&#39;t neglect the song repertoire. For instance, learning every Verdi song before you learn every aria can teach you a lot about the style. Otherwise, it&#39;s like trying to learn to pour cement at the most crucial moment in housebuilding. The arias can come a little later. </p>
<p>All those Italian songs certainly sound impressive and beautiful when sung by Luciano Pavarotti. And I&#39;ll bet you don&#39;t even want to look at them again. Can you really do without these songs that are so good for the voice? Can you do a three-second crescendo and a three-second diminuendo on the beginning of &quot;Caro mio ben,&quot; and can you get your voice even with no bumps? How many of you can do a very fine half step and whole step trill yet? What about messa di voce? Scales, thirds, ups and downs, staccatos, jumps, portamento?</p>
<p>In the long run, in spite or because of everything your teachers and coaches do, you teach yourselves. You have to find your best sound. I know you want to sing all the great operatic music, but you need good technical grounding. The song repertoire can certainly help you achieve that; the Italian song repertoire of Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, Tosti, Rossini, Respighi, Pizzetti, are all too often neglected, but are excellent to work on. </p>
<p>Almost every young voice is a lyric <em>something</em>, which is important to remember in your choice of repertoire. Also just because your voice is right for a certain aria doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re ready to sing the entire role. Entire roles require a level of stamina and maturity not usually found in very young voices. </p>
<p>Repertoire for audition has to include a piece that works for you, a piece that gets to that gravitational center of your voice soon. Where is the bulk of the beauty in your voice? And does this piece get there soon? It&#39;s like a woman&#39;s make-up. Do your make-up and dress draw us to your eyes? Or your hips? Which do you want us to look at?</p>
<p>If you have a terrific E natural, &quot;Quando m&#39;en vo&quot; from <em>La Bohème</em> can be an excellent beginning piece. If you need a longer time to warm up, maybe the recitative from Micaela&#39;s aria from <em>Carmen</em> is a better beginning. The combination of pieces that you&#39;re going to use is a very big part of your repertoire preparation in several ways. Maybe the low notes in &quot;Ah! non credea mirarte&quot; from <em>La Sonnambula</em> work better if you sing it before &quot;The Bell Song&quot; from <em>Lakmé</em>, for instance.</p>
<p>Your audition list works best if it informs your listeners instead of confusing them. Sing the repertoire you do well, and perhaps add in one aria that gives an indication of what you think you will grow into. The good-sized lyric soprano might list Micaela&#39;s aria, &quot;Mi chiamano Mimi&quot; from <em>La Bohème</em>, the &quot;Jewel Song&quot; from <em>Faust</em>, and quite possibly &quot;Tacea la notte&quot; from <em>Il Trovatore</em>. This is my present; that is my future. </p>
<p>This not only applies to opera, but to oratorio and lieder as well. You ought to be prepared in all types of music - prepared musically, vocally, dramatically and linguistically - and have each component at the highest possible level. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s go through some voice types and some <em>conceivable</em> repertoire, but before doing so, I want to emphasize that these arias are just <em>examples</em>. Even within vocal categories, repertoire differs slightly from singer to singer. Also, no singer chooses repertoire in a vacuum. You will be doing so with the help of informed teachers and coaches. And as you mature, sometimes even over a period of a few years, as more of your voice in excavated, some of your repertoire will develop and change. What I hope to do with the following examples is to help you become attuned to a discernment process and start you on the road to understanding your own voice and your own progression. There are lots of good arias for you to look at in the new anthologies. Check into them! An interesting source of arias is Tom Grubb&#39;s book, <em>Singing in French</em>. It has a list of arias for each voice type that is very comprehensive (this book is also wonderful for your French diction).</p>
<h3>The Tenor</h3>
<p>Lyric tenors. Let&#39;s say right now you&#39;re singing <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> and <em>L&#39;Elisir d&#39;Amore</em>. Perhaps you have the range and flexibility to do <em>L&#39;Italiani in Algieri</em> and some coloratura, as in the Don Ottavio role in <em>Don Giovanni</em>. But you feel as though your voice is going to develop into more <em>Rigoletto</em>, more <em>Les Contes d&#39;Hoffmann</em>, more <em>La Bohème</em>. If you&#39;re twenty-seven now, by thirty-two, it&#39;s not inconceivable that you might be growing into that repertoire, and you might want to add a fuller piece at the end of an audition list to indicate this.</p>
<p>A tenor may be singing <em>Gianni Schicchi</em> now. In five years, he may add <em>La Traviata</em>, and five years later, perhaps <em>La Bohème</em> and <em>Madama Butterfly</em>. In that situation, it can be helpful to take a Verdi piece that is somewhat full, like the aria from Macbeth - not a really killing tenor role, but a small role with a nice dramatic piece - so that you&#39;re not doing <em>Aida</em> yet, but you are doing a full Verdi aria without assuming the responsibility and difficulty of a full Verdi opera. </p>
<p>For the weightier lyric tenor, <em>Carmen</em> is nice for switching between lyric tenor and not-so-lyric tenor, as is <em>La Favorita</em>. The tenor role in <em>La Favorita</em> really progresses from lyric to heavier lyric. An aria like &quot;Pourquoi me reveiller&quot; from <em>Werther</em> is sung by both lyric and dramatic tenors, such as Franco Corelli and Nicolai Gedda. The roles of Faust and Edgardo in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> are roles that tend to stay well in the voice as the voice grows; they&#39;re not unheard of for the lyric tenor. The first act of <em>Faust</em> is a little heavy, but this is preferable to Don José in <em>Carmen</em>. Yes, José begins lyrically, but it becomes very dramatic. The title role in <em>Ernani</em>,  as another example, is a lyric tenor role that includes a very difficult dramatic aria, one which perhaps is not so easily done without a really developed technique. </p>
<p>Alfredo in <em>La Traviata</em> is a role often picked by young students, although <em>Traviata</em> is a challenging opera to sing in tune and to bring out the essence of the character for the tenor. However, Alfredo is an excellent opportunity role, as is Pinkerton in <em>Madama Butterfly</em>. Pinkerton is a heavier role because of the orchestration - you really need to be able to get over the orchestra. On the other hand, there are only two acts. If you&#39;re going to choose something that might be beyond you, better something with two acts than four. So if it&#39;s between a really heavy <em>Tosca</em> and a <em>Madama Butterfly</em>, maybe <em>Madama Butterfly</em> is better to start with. 
Ah you say, if you&#39;re talking about short operas, what about Turiddu in <em>Cavallerìa Rusticana</em>? True, Turiddu is also not long. However, it has a large, intense emotional range - it&#39;s not the same type of role as Otello, certainly, but it is an extraordinarily tense, dramatic role that can unleash the voice into perhaps unwarranted emotionalism for a young singer.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if a singer has a really lyric voice, he or she is advised to sing Mozart. But the tessitura of Mozart can be really beyond your vocal staying power at a young age. I have found Mozart to be wonderful for the voice, but sometimes just too much, too hard. Too clean a line is required, more than a young singer&#39;s technical facility can handle. Also, in the young singer, there can be a <em>misunderstanding</em> of the style required for Mozart. The inexperienced singer may hold in his or her voice in an unhealthy way, attempting a delicate approach, inhibiting rather than opening the voice. For instance, &quot;Ich baue ganz&quot; from <em>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</em> is a good piece to study for the voice, but the tessitura might not be comfortable, in which case, wait a little while. &quot;Se il mio nome&quot;, the serenade from <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, is comfortable for everybody. <em>L&#39;Elisir d&#39;Amore</em> is also wonderful to work on. <em>Manon</em>, with its good combination of lyric-dramatic is really better to study than the Italian <em>Manon Lescaut</em>, which requires a more dramatic approach. <em>Roberto Devereux</em> calls for a higher tessitura, intense drama and lyric singing. Any one of these operas mentioned can take the lyric through spinto. </p>
<p>Some tenors are well advised to look at comprimario roles, because they have the acting, musical and vocal abilities suited to these important roles. For the young man who hoped to sing Rodolfo, this might require some extra thought and planning. But every opera needs the participation of this most important voice type.</p>
<h3>The Baritone</h3>
<p>For the lyric baritone, there is <em>Don Pasquale</em>, <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, <em>Il Matrimonio Segreto</em> and the smaller roles in the bigger operas. Utilize the French repertoire - <em>not</em> Escamillo in <em>Carmen</em>, but perhaps something like Albert in <em>Werther</em>. The Count in <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em> is one of the tricky ones. It is not dramatic; on the other hand, it is also not high. The same is true of Ford in <em>Falstaff</em>, which is not particularly dramatic but requires drama in the voice. This music needs to be well thought out to be used. Operas like <em>L&#39;Incoronazione di Poppea</em> and <em>Faust</em> contain classic lyric baritone roles that can be sung from more lyric to more dramatic within themselves. You might want to practice, just for singing&#39;s sake, the Macbeth aria and <em>Don Carlo</em>, to work on good legato and good expression. But consider the tessitura of your voice and the tessitura of the piece. Sometimes the lyric voices do not yet have high notes that are easily accessible, in which case, something like <em>L&#39;Elisir d&#39;Amore</em> is wonderful. True, <em>Elisir</em> is not a dramatic piece; on the other hand, it doesn&#39;t have fourteen high G&#39;s.</p>
<p>Much of the Donizetti and Bellini repertoire is dramatic in its concept, but not in weight. Silvio in <em>I Pagliacci</em> is just as &quot;dramatic&quot; as Tonio in the same opera, but the <em>weight</em> of the voice is entirely different. Until those dramatic qualities begin to settle into the voice and personality, there are many superb operas in the early Italian repertoire, such as <em>L&#39;Italiani in Algieri</em>.</p>
<h3>The Bass</h3>
<p>Basses have an enormous flexibility of repertoire - not a lot of starring roles, but very many big ones. Those are very good ways to get yourself out onto the opera stage. Mozart has given basses magnificent roles such as Sarastro in <em>Die Zauberflöte</em> and The Commendatore in <em>Don Giovanni</em>. Osmin in <em>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</em> is a good bass role for the singer with a strong middle range and good low notes. Basilio in <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em> is an excellent singing and acting role. Many bass roles are not overly demanding; Zuniga in <em>Carmen</em>, for example, is an important role, but not lengthy one. Later, Boris Godunov is a great role the bass can look forward to. </p>
<p>Many bass <em>buffo</em> parts are sung by older baritones, and on occasion, they&#39;re not really sung at all, but rather, carried with the enormous weight of the singer&#39;s personality. I am not sure that this was intended by the composers, but it is effective. These roles have a very special tessitura, usually high. But if you really sing them with good technique, a healthy voice and a good stage presence, these can be marvelous, profitable roles. In fact, there are so many operas that we don&#39;t do much today, because this kind of bass with the proper vocal and acting ability is so hard to find (<em>Il Matrimonio Segreto</em> is one of those operas).</p>
<h3>The Soprano</h3>
<p>For the lyric soprano: <em>Les Pêcheurs de Perles</em>, for the lyric with agility, as opposed to Micaela, which is lyric without requiring agility. <em>Romeo et Juliette</em> is also lyric as far as the actual opera is concerned, but the aria has a higher extension and more flexibility. It&#39;s a nice place to start. <em>Lakmé</em> is lyric, with fiendish coloratura for the aria.</p>
<p>Adina in <em>L&#39;Elisir d&#39;Amore</em> is a great place to begin for the lyric soprano, as is Susanna in <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>. These roles allow the voice full range and do not suffocate it. They also don&#39;t have the cruel tessitura and the big high notes of <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> or <em>I Puritani</em>. For the young lyric, Lauretta in <em>Gianni Schicchi</em> is good for the voice. Much depends on the center of the voice and the flexibility, not to mention the color. Is it a brilliant or a dulcet color? Is there a plangent feeling to the sound? Or is it an exciting, edgy brilliance? Pamina, for instance, requires a special color and helps work on pianos and legato.</p>
<p>Micaela in <em>Carmen</em>, Manon in the French <em>Manon</em> and Marguerite in <em>Faust</em> are lyric roles which become a bit more dramatic. As the voice takes on more presence, with a really good A natural and high C, Mimi in <em>La Bohème</em> can be added.</p>
<p>Butterfly, while it may look easier than some big lyric roles, has a lot of wear, just for sheer on-stage time. And <em>I Pagliacci</em>, while it is short, is extremely intense. But <em>I Pagliacci</em> can be a good transition to a heavier repertoire, as can Margherite in Boito&#39;s <em>Mefistofele</em>.</p>
<p>Once in a heavier repertoire, look first at roles like Elvira in <em>Ernani</em>, Leonora in <em>Il Trovatore</em> and Violetta in <em>La Traviata</em>. These are all Verdi roles that require a rich sound with lots of flexibility. Violetta, in particular, demands a special dramatic presence and grace. Aida, Leonora in <em>La Forza del Destino</em> and Amelia in <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em> come later. At the point, you have to be very sure of the strength and tenacity of your technique and the maturity of your voice. The many Mozart heroines - Elvira and Donna Anna in <em>Don Giovanni</em>, Fiordiligi in <em>Così Fan Tutte</em>, Elektra in <em>Idomeneo</em> - provide exciting vocal adventures for the soprano. </p>
<h3>The Mezzo-Soprano</h3>
<p>Like sopranos, mezzo-sopranos come in many types: lyric, lyric coloratura, dramatic and dramatic coloratura. For lyrics, Cherubino in <em>Le Nozee di Figaro</em>, Octavian in <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>, and Charlotte in <em>Werther</em> can be looked at. The lyric coloratura finds excellent repertoire in Rossini&#39;s heroines: Rosina in <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em> and the title role in <em>La Cenerentola</em>. The Rossini tragic operas are suitable for the dramatic coloratura: <em>Semiramide</em> and <em>Tancredi</em>. The pants roles are very interesting: the Page in <em>Romeo et Juliette</em>, Smeton in <em>Roberto Devereux</em>, and many more.</p>
<p>If the tessitura of the voice lies generally high, then the bel canto repertoire is much more suitable, such as <em>Roberto Devereux</em> and <em>Norma</em> - bel canto operas that require flexibility, but not the same coloratura that is needed in <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>. If your voice is rather dramatic, then you need the slightly heavier bel canto pieces.</p>
<p>For the dramatic mezzo, there is Azucena in <em>Il Trovatore</em>, Amneris in <em>Aida</em> and the Wagner mezzo roles. Again, I urge you to look at these roles when your voice has achieved a certain level of maturity. The great mezzo Christa Ludwig began with Cherubino, the Composer and Octavian, then attacked Amneris and the Wagner and Strauss roles! Fiorenza Cossotto&#39;s early career encompassed Adalgesa and Suzuki, then Azucena and Amneris. </p>
<p>The more dramatic mezzo often chooses to audition with &quot;O don fatale&quot;, Eboli&#39;s grand aria from <em>Don Carlo</em>. It is true that this aria is a great selling piece, but it&#39;s such an advanced piece of opera (and also has the distinctive problem of having been written in French and rewritten in Italian) that it&#39;s a difficult aria to work on. Most of <em>La Favorita</em> is wonderful; however, the aria is treacherous because it passes in and out of what some people call &quot;breaks&quot;. It will either help train you or show up your difficulty. But the rest of the opera is great.</p>
<h3>The &quot;In-Between Voice&quot;</h3>
<p>There are different kinds of casting that go on all the time. Zerlina in <em>Don Giovanni</em> is often a cross-over, done by both mezzos and sopranos. The best way to answer a casting question is to figure out where your voice works. Where is the center of gravity in your voice? Work in the tessitura of your voice that&#39;s accessible - for <em>Le Troyens</em>, <em>Pelléas et Mélisande</em> and <em>L&#39;Incoronazione di Poppea</em>, you can be a mezzo or soprano. Carmen has been sung by sopranos and mezzos; Cherubino is at times sung by lyrics sopranos.</p>
<p>There is the often disconcerting, but exciting process of a young mezzo whose voice is decidedly going up. These singers must learn to accept nature&#39;s decision and enjoy the process. If you&#39;re switching from mezzo to soprano, Musetta in <em>La Bohème</em> can be very helpful, as can the Desdemona aria, bringing you into the soprano world little by little. &quot;L&#39;Altra Notte&quot; from <em>Mefistofele</em> is also helpful in carrying over your training. </p>
<p>There are even those medium baritone roles for the person who is caught between tenor and baritone and who is not sure whether he&#39;s going up or down. Pelléas, if you&#39;re a superb musician and have a gift for French, can be a role for the person in between, as well as Eisenstein in <em>Die Fledermaus</em>, Danilo in <em>The Merry Widow</em> and Nerone in <em>L&#39;Incoronazione di Poppea</em>. Those are four roles for somebody not sure where their voice is, a common problem for young baritones. </p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s important to sound like what you are, but not too early. You might not know before age twenty-seven what your voice wants to be. Do not impose. Let your voice go where it wants. Be a good teacher and a good parent and a good trainer. Your voice sometimes doesn&#39;t start off where it&#39;s going to end up. This is not a crime against nature. Wasn&#39;t Mr. Bergonzi a baritone, and wasn&#39;t Ms. Scotto a mezzo-soprano? Juan Pons was a bass. This is the result of a voice&#39;s taking away certain things that it finds it doesn&#39;t need to do, and like the wonderful helium balloon, up it goes. Or in some cases, down it goes. The idea is to follow your voice, be flexible. And it&#39;s often the case that someone has the soul of an Italian, but their voice cries out to sing German. There is no reason why the voice shouldn&#39;t have its way.</p>
<h3>What You Do Best</h3>
<p>&quot;But everybody tells me a different thing&quot; is a common problem. Don&#39;t worry (if you can help it). As your voice takes on more personality, more assurance, it will settle down into what it does best. But in the beginning, it&#39;s rather changeable and, of course, frustrating.</p>
<p>Vocal category is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You won&#39;t be a better person if you&#39;re a tenor. You won&#39;t be a better person if you&#39;re a mezzo-soprano; you&#39;ll just work less, if you are really a soprano trying to be a mezzo-soprano.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what kind of personality you could play on the stage. Are you a Don Giovanni or a Leporello? Some singers have to look for a long time to find repertoire in which they are marketable; it&#39;s like trying on clothes. However, once they find that repertoire and make a name for themselves, it seems there&#39;s nothing they <em>can&#39;t</em> sing.</p>
<p>And what some voices do best is versatility. A smaller theater can say, This singer can do <em>Don Pasquale</em>, <em>L&#39;Elisir D&#39;Amore</em> and <em>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</em>. Terrific! Or, This lady can sing Aida and Marguerite. Maybe she&#39;s not our perfect Aida, but we need one to do both.</p>
<h3>Modern Repertoire</h3>
<p>In your search for repertoire, don&#39;t neglect the contemporary operas. Sometimes a young singer with a strong personality can tap into the modern repertoire beautifully and not reveal the kind of line he or she doesn&#39;t have. It&#39;s quite amazing how voices that do not seem to fit into standard <em>Butterfly-Bohème-Rigoletto</em> repertoire find gorgeous homes in an American piece of music. If you want a nice surprise, tape yourself doing something dramatic and interesting in English, and then tape yourself doing another aria in Italian. See if you don&#39;t find what a natural performer you are in one and what an unnatural performer you may be in the other. We&#39;re becoming richer and richer in very singable contemporary music. So really research this repertoire. And you can use the experience of interacting in your own language; carry it over when working in other languages. </p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>A common question concerns whether a singer without a particularly Italianate sound, a lyric tenor perhaps, should work on something like <em>L&#39;Elisir D&#39;Amore</em> for auditioning purposes, where the chances are very high that the more Italian sound will get the role. My answer is to work on it, because it helps you develop what you don&#39;t have. It is, however, not the aria to start with in your audition process. We don&#39;t show off what we don&#39;t have. The first singing teacher I ever played for said, &quot;If you don&#39;t have the <em>décolleté</em>, don&#39;t wear it.&quot; Sing an American aria first. Sing French, sing German, sing something by Benjamin Britten that really personalizes the color of your voice. Once you&#39;ve done that, one of your choices can be <em>Elisir</em>. If they want it, they&#39;ll ask for it. For &quot;getting hired&quot; purposes, it&#39;s really good to do what you do best. </p>
<p>Another question concerns the advisability of singing obscure music in an audition. My experience is, if you sing such music, judges tend to listen to the music with great interest, taking the focus off you, the singer. On the other hand, obscure music can be a great help in hiding a few flaws if you&#39;re not vocally in the best of condition. The bottom line is, always sing what represents you the best. My favorite question to ask a coaching student is, &quot;Why are you singing this?&quot; The answer often is, &quot;I need an aria in English (or French or Italian).&quot; This is valid, but decide what it is you hope to achieve with the aria. It is preferable to say, &quot;It is what I do best. It shows me off.&quot;</p>
<p>When a piece in English is required at an audition, be clever and inventive. One alternative is to sing something in translation, and chances are, the opera company is not asking for an English aria unless they&#39;re doing something in English. You&#39;d be wise to know what that opera is. Do they perform operas written in English, or are they doing something in translation? In a contest or competition, if the judges want to hear how you do in English, something in translation would be fine. However, there are more and more exciting contemporary operas available today. It is a valuable experience to research these operas and learn something that was written in English.</p>
<p>Eventually, your voice will reach its final growth. After singing a particular repertoire for a number of years, you have a choice of whether or not to go on to a more dramatic repertoire, which can be very interesting and which lots of singers do. Singer approach bigger repertoire for many reasons: musical curiosity, desire to explore the dramatic and musical depths of that music, or let&#39;s face it - boredom. Singers are human, and after a twenty-five year career of singing <em>I Puritani</em>, often a successful tenor want to try Otello. Whether a singer should or shouldn&#39;t continue into a bigger repertoire is a very personal question which can only be answered by the singer, along with a teacher and coaches. However, these steps shouldn&#39;t be taken until proper vocal maturity has been reach.</p>
<p>Repertoire is your steppingstone to the rich worlds of music and your own vocal life, but growth in repertoire is not something to be rushed. Learn what your music has to teach you before moving on. </p>
<h2>The Language</h2>
<p>Translation. Do it. Just do it. And then redo it.</p>
<p>Opera is not only an intellectual form, but an emotional and very human one. A voice can express enormous humanity and an incredible range of emotion. For these reasons, a singer must understand much more than the general meaning in the text. One cannot sing in generalities. Each word has to become a real word, specific and intense, and you cannot just know what the sentence means. I repeat: <em>it is not enough to know what the sentence means.</em></p>
<h3>Understanding the Text</h3>
<p>When I say to a singer, &quot;Will you translate this for me?&quot; the answer is invariably, &quot;Oh, sure, just let me get my music.&quot; From that statement, I have to assume that the singer has not yet absorbed the <em>meaning</em>. Not only do you have to internalize the text so that it seems as though you have been speaking these words all your life, but the words themselves have to provoke emotional responses within you. Which means that when you translate, you cannot <em>only</em> translate word for word. &quot;<em>Si</em>&quot; - &quot;yes.&quot; &quot;<em>Mi chiamano</em>&quot; - &quot;they call me.&quot; &quot;<em>Si</em>&#39; might be, &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;well,&quot; &quot;okay,&quot; &quot;gee.&quot; &quot;<em>Mi chiamano</em>&quot; could be &quot;My friends call me,&quot; &quot;They call me,&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve always been called.&quot; Not just one word or phrase. This is especially true in the translation of adjectives: the richer, the better.</p>
<p>When you look in a dictionary, there are perhaps four definitions for a word. Instead of just writing down one definition, write down all four. Use all four definitions and then create an image of what that word feels like, looks like, tastes like. The same way your nose recognizes the smell of an Italian restaurant, your emotional being has to recognize the emotional quality of a word like <em>orrore</em>.</p>
<p>Even though you don&#39;t speak the language, and we cannot require of singers that they fluently speak four languages - they usually haven&#39;t got the time - the internalization of a word can be done all day long by just using it in place of the English one. &quot;Ah that&#39;s a very <em>bella</em> dress.&quot; Make these words into pictures, use them, make them your own. As a student, make the in-depth study of language a large part of your undergraduate work. This is the very best time to begin building your vocabulary and enriching your knowledge of language.</p>
<h3>Finding the Nuances</h3>
<p>Sometimes the large dictionaries are good for giving you the shading of words. A dictionary that has synonyms is excellent. Or even better, a person who has a real in-depth knowledge of the language and the way it&#39;s used, such as a professor of poetry in French or Italian, can give you all the colors of the word. (And don&#39;t waste your time asking this person to only give a general sentence translation.) You can use the excellent translation books or the libretti included with recordings for general ideas.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>godiamo</em>, a word which appears in the &quot;Brindisi,&quot; Act I, of <em>La Traviata</em>, has a very sensual connotation. You might ask your expert to tell you about the verb <em>godere</em>. How is that word used? Can I use it about cauliflower, or should I use it about sex? Tell me about the word piacere. Does it have to do with &quot;mildly pleasing&quot; or does it have to do with &quot;enjoyable?&quot; Give me ten sentences with this word.</p>
<p>A construction such as that used by Germont in <em>La Traviata</em>  - &quot;<em>Il padre in me vedete</em> - is formal and ponderous, purposely so. It doesn&#39;t say, &quot;I am Alfredo&#39;s father.&quot; It says, &quot;In me, you see the personage of...&quot; It has a special significance, connotation and weight.</p>
<p>Then there is the &quot;Voi che sapete&quot; of Cherubino - &quot;You who know.&quot; If you look up &quot;to know&quot; in the Shakespearean dictionary, the meaning includes, &quot;to have carnal knowledge of,&quot; not only &quot;to be acquainted.&quot; <em>Sapere</em> means &quot;to know&quot; and <em>conoscere</em> means &quot;to know.&quot; So why didn&#39;t Mozart use <em>conoscere</em>? And notice how Mozart always goes up in the music on the word &quot;know.&quot; <em>Amor</em> could be many things - love, desire, sex. The word <em>cor</em> as used by Cherubino means &quot;heart,&quot; but the heart can be in a lot of places. <em>Provare</em> in Italian means &quot;to rehearse&quot;; it also means &quot;to feel.&quot; So it&#39;s not just a word, but a combination of word and idea. &quot;Quello ch&#39;io provo vi ridirò; è per me nuovo, capir nol so,&quot; Cherubino says. &quot;That which I want to do over again I think about and rehearse in my mind.&quot; What is he thinking about? What does he want to rehearse?</p>
<p>In <em>Così Fan Tutte</em>, there are obvious double entendres when the women talk about how big the men&#39;s noses and feet are. Yes, opera is often about sex. As a great acting teacher, Ludwig Donath, said, &quot;<em>Don Giovanni</em> is about sex, sex, sex and a little murder.&quot; The same can be said for many operas: they are non-vulgarly, healthfully, youthfully about sex. And if we&#39;re not used to working with the text enough to enjoy this beautiful refreshing approach, we miss it. Cherubino is a great example of this: he doesn&#39;t say &quot;<em>dì nè notte,</em>&quot; he says &quot;<em>notte nè dì</em>&quot; - &quot;I can&#39;t find any peace of mind night nor day.&quot; Somehow, night always comes first to Cherubino. And when you look at Zerlina&#39;s aria, &quot;Batti, batti,&quot; in Don Giovanni, she also says &quot;notte e dì.&quot; Mozart obviously enjoyed &quot;night and day&quot; more than &quot;day and night!&quot;</p>
<h3>The Mechanics of Translation and Subtext</h3>
<p>What I find helpful is to gather an excellent dictionary and paper and pencil. Write out your text and, as you do, say it out loud. By the time you&#39;ve written a double consonant, i.e., the two b&#39;s in <em>babbo</em>, you&#39;ve also said them in just the right way. Or the two n&#39;s in <em>vanno</em>. And your mouth begins to get used to saying these words as a string of consonants and vowels, as your eyes see them and your hand writes them.</p>
<p>Skip several lines on your page so you can write three or four meanings for each word, the richest meanings you can. Underneath that, write an English sentence. And underneath that, write a very colloquial sentence that reflects your own personality or the subtext. Use modern, everyday words - words <em>you</em> might use. When you do this, the whole process has much less chance of being vague, it becomes more precise and gives your own flavor to the meaning of the words. This gives you additional resources. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s take apart some of the language of &quot;Musetta&#39;s Waltz&quot; from <em>La Bohème</em> for meaning and subtext.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Quando m&#39;en vo...&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;When I take myself out...&quot;</p>
<p>(He knows when you take yourself out, Musetta, you always put on your sexiest dress.)</p>
<p><em>&quot;Soletta...&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;All alone...&quot;</p>
<p>(Without you, darling.)</p>
<p><em>&quot;Per la via...&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;On the boulevard...&quot;</p>
<p>(Not on the back streets where you take me.)</p>
<p><em>&quot;La gente sosta e mira.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;The people just stop and look.&quot;</p>
<p>(They just stop and look at my dress, the one you didn&#39;t buy me.)</p>
<p>You can be more inventive than the obvious meanings. And ask yourself, What did Puccini mean when he wrote about a woman&#39;s &quot;hidden&quot; beauty? Followed by &quot;<em>e tu che sai</em>&quot; - &quot;you who know where that hidden beauty is.&quot; Notice a form of the verb <em>sapere</em> again.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Che memori e ti struggi...</em>&quot; One of the meanings of <em>struggere</em> is when the seventeenth person in the line cuts in front of you, and you can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>At the end of Musetta&#39;s Waltz, &quot;<em>... ma ti senti morir</em>&quot; is a phrase for being very aroused and involved sexually or sexually frustrated. It has nothing to do with really dying. It is tastefully sensual. </p>
<p>You need to translate your languages into your being and into your heart, your eyes. You begin on paper; you end in your imagination.</p>
<p>Plugging a foreign word into an emotion is something few other people in theatrical world have to do. This makes learning acting as an opera singer different from other forms of theater, and quite a bit more complicated. There&#39;s not only a strange language, but also the singing to deal with! Even if you study acting with a fine teacher, you still have to deal with traveling through another language in order to get at an emotional system. And <em>emotion</em> is what carries meaning. So ask yourself if you are singing in the language, not translating as you sing. Speak your piece through in English a few times, then in the original language a few times. Set up a chain of thoughts between the words in the aria or song and your thoughts in natural English. </p>
<p>I highly recommend the William Weaver libretti and <em>The Ring of Words</em> by Philip L. Miller to give you a whole idea of what&#39;s going on in a piece. What&#39;s nice about the Weaver books is that on the page opposite the libretto, he writes the translation out in full, not hyphenated as in the music. This is important, because the words become easily readable and more real. Read them into your tape recorder, really making an actor&#39;s sense out of them, and hear yourself saying those words as words, sentences and phrases. Then you&#39;ll find that the phrasing in your singing becomes much more automatic. </p>
<h3>Translating the Entire Opera</h3>
<p>So much for the audition arias. But what do you do in a full opera when your colleague is singing, and you don&#39;t understand a blessed word of what he&#39;s saying? And what&#39;s more, you simply can&#39;t memorize all of his or her words, because you have to do this opera in a month, and it would take you seven years to digest all that translation!</p>
<p>Well, get the libretto, and find a word you understand. &quot;<em>Intendo,</em>&quot; let&#39;s say. It means &quot;to understand,&quot; &quot;to comprehend.&quot; So now you can listen to a sentence and react to the word &quot;<em>intendo.</em>&quot; You can learn two words out of every sentence or out of every two sentences that your colleague sings and react to those words. &quot;<em>Finalmente mia,</em>&quot; Scarpia says. Tosca, you know what that means. Circle the easy words, the strong words, the words that appeal to you emotionally. Learn those, and associate a reaction. Later on, the stage director may agree or disagree, but the word will have some significant meaning. With each rehearsal and performance that you do, you will add more words, and by the time you&#39;re on your tenth repetition, you&#39;re well on your way to understanding everything that your colleague says. That way, you&#39;re really becoming an integrated part of the performance. </p>
<p>Without this type of work, as we have seen in so many performances and videotapes, it becomes obvious who is on the stage just waiting to react, instead of truly understanding while the other person is singing. On a videotape, you see that the camera generally moves away from those people. The audience in the theater does not have that choice. Go to a performance of a Broadway show, and see what it looks like when everybody understands what&#39;s being said. Go to an original-language performance of, say, <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, when half the cast is Italian and half is American, and you often have no trouble seeing who understands and who does not. </p>
<h3>Pronunciation and Diction</h3>
<p>The second component of language is, of course, the pronunciation/diction component. There are those singers who are extraordinarily gifted linguistically, and then there are those who really have to work. But excellent pronunciation and diction can be achieved by almost everyone. It gets back to the idea of controlling what you can versus worrying about what you cannot. Be great at what&#39;s possible. Okay, tenor, maybe you can&#39;t be 6&#39;2&#39;&#39;, but you can communicate with great success. Maybe you don&#39;t have a good high C yet. But there are other things you can have, such as imaginative, musical, stylistic phrasing and the ability to produce music that is very expressive. These elements are really based on understanding the language.</p>
<p>I was once involved in auditions for <em>Madama Butterfly</em> with an Italian conductor. We listened to ten different people, and not one of them could sing Italian acceptably for the maestro. Put yourself in his shoes. Supposing you went to see a production of <em>Oklahoma!</em> and heard Curly sing, &quot;Oh Vat a Bootiful Mornink?&quot; Many, if not most young American singers sound like Americans singing in French or Italian or German. Every school gives a few months of pronunciation classes, during which time you can just about learn that there is such a thing. There are also lots and lots of books (better than nothing). But books can&#39;t hear you.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, you need to know where to double the consonant in Italian and where you can&#39;t, when you have to shorten a vowel in German, when you have to slightly change a vowel in French to make it thyme with a vowel that preceded it, how open the &quot;schwa&quot; vowel has to be. All of these things are extraordinarily important! It&#39;s also very interesting to take an aria, maybe one from <em>La Bohème</em>, as sung by three different tenors, tape the renditions and listen to each one of them. Listen to the Italian singer, the American - whomever you find - and notice what they do. Then read some very good books on diction. Colorni has written an extremely helpful one. The <em>Zingarelli</em> dictionary is absolutely indispensable; it has all the words written out in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and gives you all the open and closed sounds. An open or closed vowel can completely change the meaning of a word. Take a look at the list of words that cause phrasal doubling, that is, the internal doubling of the initial consonant. Then go back to your recordings and make yourself aware of phrasal doublings; for example, &quot;E <em>t</em>ardi&quot; (<em>La Traviata</em>), me <em>p</em>overetta (<em>La Bohème</em>). If you can&#39;t afford this wonderful dictionary, ask for it for Christmas or your birthday. </p>
<p>English is a language in which we bounce off our consonants when we are angry:&quot;I could <em>k</em>ill him.&quot; Italians, to express that kind of emotion, go for the vowel:&quot;I k<em>ee</em>l you.&quot; Intense emotion in the Italian language is carried by the vowels. &quot;<em>Quando m&#39;en vo.</em>&quot; Make those vowels long! Then you can go easily into the consonant, making it resonant, and then go right away into the next vowel. In order to bring emphasis to a word in Italian, you can just change the pitch. Each one of these different arrangements of pitches holds a great deal of meaning and replaces the need to make heavy accents. This type of intensive work will do wonders for your legato. The presence of vowel thrown next to vowel with a clear, sharp consonant in between is what makes this type of singing so gorgeous. </p>
<p>Tom Grubb&#39;s book, <em>Singing in French</em>, is another effective tool. Immerse yourself slowly in this book, and he will help you learn the difference between French and Italian music and language. Jeannine Reiss is a marvelous French diction coach. When you see her name on the back of a recording, you&#39;re going to be listening to good French. So many young singers are tempted to close off their voices when singing in French. I admit it&#39;s perhaps not the easiest language in the world to sing at first, but by exposing yourself to the wonderful teaching of Grubb, the coaching of Reiss, and the singing of artists such as Regine Crespin, you have an excellent start on recognizing what good, well-sung French sounds like.</p>
<h3>A Good Example</h3>
<p>Talking about vowels and reading about them on the page are not nearly the same as hearing them or doing them. Each language has its proper vocalic placement in the same way that French, Italian and German restaurants have their particular aroma. Vowel sounds are something that can only truly be taught by somebody sitting with you.</p>
<p>Listen to a recording of someone whose pronunciation is impeccable. Sherrill Milnes&#39; Italian is wonderful. Nicolai Gedda&#39;s pronunciation is flawless. Callas&#39;s Italian is expressive and beautiful. Gwyneth Jones&#39; German is masterful. Record them. Record you. Tape Freni singing &quot;Mi chiamano Mimi.&quot; When you hear &quot;<em>A tela o seta ricamo in casa e fuori</em>&quot; - a line that most young sopranos usually turn backward and inside out - see if your vowels sound like the vowels you&#39;re hearing on the recording. If you approach each language as if you were about to make your debut at La Scala, you&#39;ll make very strict rules for yourself. </p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to say, &quot;Well, you know, So and So&#39;s (famous star) Italian was never really...&quot; To all statements like this, I have only one thing to say: if your voice is just as extraordinary - okay. But make sure you are vocally in that category before you say, &quot;I don&#39;t really have to work on my acting, phrasing, music, language, diction or pronunciation.&quot;</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have access to somebody who can really go through the language in a precise way, what are your options? One is to pretend you&#39;re five years old and read syllable by syllable, as slowly and as beautifully as you can. With the use of a cassette tape, you can make use of pronunciation by mail from an expert who lives far away from you. Learn the names of the top language coaches, look for their names on recordings and utilize their language expertise. </p>
<p>There is a lot of help available, many master classes, many situations in which you can learn the rules of language. If you are serious about this business of singing, you can expect language to be one of the biggest components. </p>
<p>The frequent use of subtitles in performances these days does afford you more opportunity to work in an original language, which is, of course, better for the voice. Despite this advantage, you still must work on the absorption of text and on the vocal, emotional and physical ability to deliver it. This absorption comes together with style, knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>Language is not something you just pick up and do. Each language has a style. Italian, with its lack of &quot;schwa&quot; vowels; French, with its varied hues and colors of vowels; German, with its &quot;schwa&quot; vowels and umlauts - all need to be carefully looked into. Never mind that we&#39;re also singing opera in Czechoslovakian and Russian!</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t Forget English</h3>
<p>And what about the command of your own language? Just because it&#39;s your language doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have to study it. In English, singers fight to emphasize consonants more and more. Consonants are important, but one of the biggest problems is understanding the vowels. It&#39;s a fallacy that English isn&#39;t clear only because of consonants. Also, many singers do not put enough emphasis on the &quot;hummed&quot; and &quot;sung-through&quot; sounds: &quot;ths,&quot; &quot;n,&quot; &quot;m,&quot; and &quot;l.&quot; More attention to IPA is helpful. English works like any other language, except it&#39;s not spelled out. In the decision of which IPA symbol to use, you achieve more of an understanding of what the vowel is <em>supposed</em> to be. Take apart the diphthongs. For &quot;I know&quot; - write &quot;Ai-ee no-u.&quot; In IPA: &quot;Ai nou.&quot; Go through a piece several times slowly. This is the way non-English-speaking singers learn English. For reference, both Madeleine Marshall and Dorothy Uris have written good books on English diction. </p>
<p>There is no reason to burden yourself with poor pronunciation and poor diction. When you&#39;re too young to work yourself intensively vocally, work yourself intensively linguistically. Go right ahead and do it. </p>
<h2>The Music</h2>
<p>Simple things. Melody, rhythm, harmony. Simple. But so easily overlooked, ill-prepared and under-enjoyed.</p>
<p>When studying music, it is best to do it right the first time. Otherwise, there is nothing that comes back as quickly as your first mistake. So let&#39;s avoid the first mistake. Get a good foundation in your aria <em>now</em>. Otherwise, fixing them can be a most tiresome, expensive and frustrating proceeding. If you don&#39;t learn it right the first time, you can pay your coach year after year to correct you. Sometimes I find myself making circles around the circles I made last year.</p>
<p>The key to learning a piece of music correctly and wisely, in my opinion, is in knowing <em>how</em> to study. Many singers set aside an hour or two a day and sing through their pieces. They stop and start, but still, they are working on each <em>entire</em> piece, rather than finding a style of study that really works. There are many ways. Ask advice, look around, try different things. </p>
<p>For instance, try this. Sing through the aria once for fun. Then, start really <em>working</em> on it. Dissect it. Work on small section of four bars at a time, eight bars a day, examining in depth every detail of those measures. Then put them together. It&#39;s so much more cost-efficient in terms of labor and helps you not to miss any important features of the piece.</p>
<p>When beginning your study of a piece of music, never, but never, sing anything without going to the library, finding the orchestra score and reading the fifteen or so pages on which your aria is written. It doesn&#39;t take long. Compare the dots on your notes to the dots on the notes in the score. Compare the words, compare the phrasing, compare the bowing, so that you can see when the violins play with you and when the French horn does. That <em>p</em> can stand for many different things. Know what they are! There&#39;s nothing like seeing the music spread out in the orchestra score and noticing all the different instruments the piano represents. Then the accompaniment becomes understandable. And, of course, you will check pitch for pitch, note for note, against the music you&#39;re using.</p>
<h3>Errors in the Music</h3>
<p>There are some horrendous mistakes, musical and verbal, in some of the musical anthologies. One of my personal favorites is the bass, in &quot;Infelice! E tu credevi&quot; in Act I of <em>Ernani</em>, who speaks of the eyebrow on a portion of his anatomy with the immortal line, &quot;<em>Si bel ciglio immaculato,</em>&quot; instead of &quot;<em>giglio immacolato.</em>&quot; Had you translated the aria, you would most certainly know &quot;<em>ciglio immaculato</em>&quot; could not <em>possibly</em> be correct!</p>
<p>Then there was the soprano who sang &quot;Pace, pace mio dio&quot; from <em>La Forza del Destino</em>, and I said to her, &quot;Have you ever heard this before?&quot; &quot;Yes, many times.&quot; &quot;Did you ever notice that other sopranos are singing different notes from the ones you&#39;re singing at the end?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; There were wrong notes printed in her book.</p>
<p>We have new versions, old versions and revised versions of many scores today. There are new versions of operas coming out all the time. Many Rossini and Verdi scores are being revised. How nice it would be if you could take advantage of all this right from the beginning of your studies. Take the time to compare everything that&#39;s written in your score. In the &quot;Ballatella&quot; from <em>I Pagliacci</em>, for instance, the accompaniment is incomplete as it is written in the piano version. Write it out for your pianists. Baritones singing &quot;Avant de quitter ces lieux,&quot; Valentine&#39;s aria in <em>Faust</em> - there&#39;s a whole other world to be added in the accompaniment of the aria. Write it in your book so the pianist will play it. Almost all the scores have a major mistake in the accompaniment of the Micaela-Don José duet. In &quot;Depuis le jour&quot; from <em>Louise</em>, there are very important tempi markings missing that you can find in the score. There are also accompaniment figures missing that make the aria easier to sing. It is critical that you have a good coach who can advise you in these matter.</p>
<h3>Practice Time</h3>
<p>You will evolve your own work style, but as I mentioned. I highly recommend a slow study of a few measures at a time. I think it&#39;s far better to take four bars of music and look at them for five to ten minutes on the clock, really studying their internal structure, harmony, melody, their reason for being, the commas - every single fly speck in those four bars - until the questions begin to come to your mind. Why is this rhythm like this? Why is this like bar like that? What do they mean? Four bars tomorrow, four bars the next day. You can study your trills for five minutes, a cup of tea, in no way exhausting yourself. But in a week, with four bars of really thoughtful work a day, you will have that piece so well thought out that you can really begin to sing it. You will practically have it memorized. You have no chance of putting an &quot;r&quot; in a wrong place. In half a hour, you can study sixteen bars, which is a great deal. Singers always seem to feel the need to spend fifteen minutes singing a piece from beginning to end. I don&#39;t think that helps when you are beginning to study.</p>
<p>Continuous work is important, even if you put in just half an hour each day. Most of you have jobs or go to school all day, and of course, you&#39;re tired. But try physical exercise in the morning, then a vocal warm-up and technique exercises, and soon you will be asking, Is it this vowel or that vowel that needs work? on the way to the stockroom. At lunch time, run into a church and do a little work on your vocal technique. Come home, have a little dinner and do a little exercise, and either take out the tape your pianist made for you or go to your pianist, even for half an hour. If you feel fine, sing your pieces. If you don&#39;t feel that energetic, mark a few of the high notes and work out the problems of the other pieces. Is this legato enough? Does this require a portamento? Did I do too much? Did I begin my first note properly? Did I end my last note properly? If you&#39;re too tired to sing, there&#39;s always language or translation. </p>
<p>People are busier now than ever before. But you can make the time to do anything you want, <em>if</em> you learn how to use your time effectively. Buses, subways, planes, taxis and streetcars are good places to read the history you need in order to do an opera, to work on translation, to listen to language tapes, to listen to music tapes, aria in hand. Time sitting on the couch is great for watching and analyzing performance videos. Use the available half-hour here and there, or even the available fifteen minutes, to vocalize, to work on a translation, to study coloratura, trills, etc. And within all of this, yes, there has to be time completely <em>away</em> from study and from the opera business. It is essential to recharge. And you&#39;ll be surprised, after a day or a weekend or an evening free of study and concentration, how fresh your approach is when you return to the work. </p>
<h3>Rhythm and Tempo</h3>
<p>So many  young singers lose track of some of the most central issues. First of all, the how of everything and secondly, the why of everything. It saddens me to find somebody who has never discovered the joy of what we teach all five-year-olds to do when we teach them to play the piano - count. But somehow, as soon as many musicians start to sing, counting becomes secondary. When you remove the spine of the musical skeleton, the same thing will happen to the music that will happen if you remove the spine from your body: you will be left in a rather unflattering heap.</p>
<p>Finding the tempo is another important element. You have to see the tempo,  the speed of the music,  as a bicycle that you can peddle faster or slower as you want. Go smoothly into the changes. Verdi&#39;s sixteenth notes, dotted eighth notes or triplets are little maps of the emotions which provoked those rhythms. The tempo at which these rhythms move changes their emotional messages to the audience. </p>
<p>Tempo is also important for the movement of your own individual voice. Does your voice need a slower tempo, a faster tempo, does this phrase need to move ahead? How will you plan out the tempo in order to breath easier here, and not have to breathe there?</p>
<p>The music must have an inner rhythmic structure. We can be extraordinarily sophisticated about rhythms, or we can be extremely simple. But the pattern is like the biological rhythms in our bodies. Our heartbeat is so necessary, speeding up and slowing down, that we don&#39;t even think about it. And the same with the rhythms of music. The people who have not taken the time to count and study the rhythm of the recitative to &quot;Sempre libera&quot; from <em>La Traviata</em> have missed an enormously perceptive composer&#39;s feeling of emotions translated into rhythm. </p>
<p>Understanding the immense importance of the rhythms, tempi and the relationship that holds the orchestra together with you and eighter other people on the stage is crucial. There is no room for nearly, maybe or sort of.</p>
<p>Some opera houses, especially large international ones, have a prompter. Working with a prompter is fun, because it reassures the singer that a word or a rest won&#39;t be forgotten as the performer becomes more involved in the drama, has a memory slip or any one of the thousand unexpected situation that routinely occur. However, as a beginning singer, you&#39;re not likely to have a prompter. Nor should anyone depend on the prompter in order to sing the music correctly. In addition, when you get into a bigger theater, your conductor expects you to be &quot;on top&quot; of the rhythm. Your sense of rhythm has to be secure enough to sing <em>ahead</em>, so that you are with the orchestra. The stage is large, and the orchestra pit is often big as well. Sound takes time to travel, and the further back on the stage you go, the more you must anticipate. The conductor has a lot of responsibility and many facts of a performance that need his attention. If you can&#39;t stay with him, you may find yourself being dismissed or simply not rehired. A coach who has had a great deal of experience in a theater and working with conductors can advise and assist you in preparing to work with a conductor and orchestra. It will be unusual to find a conductor who doesn&#39;t allow you to discuss tempi, particularly where you vocal necessities are involved, but you both owe each other the most meticulous rhythmical preparation.</p>
<p>Even the youngest singer has the ability to dissect rhythm. Count, conduct your pieces, figure out what kind of motions this conductor is going to go through. Go to a performance and watch the conductor. Sing along with the singers (in your head, of course!). Find a recording. Conduct it. Locate a student conductor or young professional, and ask him or her to conduct you through an aria. See what kinds of problems you encounter. Begin to establish for yourself the ways in which beats, as unites of time, look and feel and, most importantly, what they mean. The aria from <em>Werther</em> is a wonderful example: &quot;Je devrais les détruire.&quot; The last two syllables of &quot;<em>détruire</em>&quot; are a dotted rhythm. In my opinion, these have to be sung as written to show Charlotte&#39;s uncertainty. She&#39;s staying, &quot;Do I have to destroy these?&quot; This is a spot that lends itself to carelessness and, when done incorrectly, can change the intention to one of the absolute certainty:&quot;I have to destroy these.&quot; The correct rhythm makes it so clear that the audience understands. </p>
<p>I&#39;m also not talking about a solfége prison. I&#39;m talking about the spine of the music, the process that allows it to be flexible, that allows it to move, to go forward, that allows your breath to find its way of supporting you in the arch of the melody and enables you to build the frame over which to put your canvas. The architecture of the music has to be so completely <em>understood</em> that what the composer intended is accurately transmitted.</p>
<p>Look at how much information you can perceive just from the attitude of somebody&#39;s spine. You can get as much information from whether the rhythm is sixteenth notes or half notes. And here, the singer has full emotional choice. Why is this rhythm this way? It&#39;s up to you. So count. Write the numbers in your book. Don&#39;t be ashamed. Buy a new piece of music if you don&#39;t want your teachers to see it. Your music is your work paper, your workbook. You will discover the rich imagination that you have as you ponder the rhythms and absorb how they are and why they are. When we discuss reasons for the emotional whys of the rhythms, there are very few ways to be wrong.</p>
<p>It was for a while a tradition, especially among Italian voice teachers and conductors that I was so fortunate to work with, to say, No, my dear, it goes like this. And you did it like this, and that was that, no questions. It was valuable to get the benefit of their experience and brilliant insights into the music, but there is a difference between learning the music with integrity and just being &quot;correct.&quot; After all, being merely correct is not the point; we don&#39;t become artists to play it safe. We bemoan the lack of grand personality in singers today; this is part of the high price to be paid for being so &quot;correct.&quot; When we allow singers to study only in this fashion, we end up with the vanilla soprano, the homogenized mezzo, the blank baritone and the behaviorless bass. Unless we protect that combination of the singer&#39;s personality and the personality of the music, which always and eternally strike different sparks together, we rob ourselves of new interpretation and a great deal of new insight into the music.</p>
<p>Putting you personality, your imagination, your emotion into your music, together with the insights and experience of others, is essential. But don&#39;t etch your decision in stone. Establish flexible opinions, because for all of your life, you&#39;ll find a conductor who does it another way and a director who does it a third way. And each time, the combination will produce new and exciting results.</p>
<h3>Harmony</h3>
<p>Really get acquainted with harmony. Let somebody play the music through for you or play it yourself. Remember all those hours spent in Harmony class? Now is the time to reap the benefit of all the work you put into those classes. Hear and rehear the pieces that are all too familiar and find what&#39;s new and wonderful in the harmonies. Learn how the harmonies speak to you emotionally.</p>
<p>For instance, for sopranos who sing Pamina&#39;s aria, &quot;Ach, ich fühls&quot; from <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>&quot;, renew your acquaintanceship with the <em>incredible</em> dissonance in the harmony and chromatics of the harmonic structure; the chords that don&#39;t go where you expect them, except that you&#39;ve heard this aria so often, you thoroughly expect them to go there. In <em>La Bohème</em>, at the end of the aria &quot;Addio, senza rancor,&quot; that little modulation after &quot;<em>Se vuoi, se vuoi...</em>&quot; is such a surprise! If you had never heard it before, you would have goose bumps all over. Let the pianist play it so it sounds new again. Re-listen, re-think, re-find.  It requires that you be very quiet and open your ears to what&#39;s there.</p>
<p>Cherubino&#39;s aria again affords a wonderful example of seeing and hearing what&#39;s really in the music. It&#39;s a familiar aria, yet when you realize that the subject matter about which the pubescent Cherubino is singing and then look at your music, you have a wealth of understanding of this aria and of the reasons for the harmonic structure and can bring so much more to it as a performer. &quot;This is all new for me...&quot; goes into a minor chord and ends in a major chord on &quot;understand.&quot; Look at the music underneath, at what Mozart did with major and minor chords and putting notes together.</p>
<p>One fun mental exercise I like to do with my students is what I call the &quot;five-year-old.&quot; I learned this from a fine soprano and a lot of five-year-olds. Children go straight to the emotional heart of the music. Do a five-year-old exercise for yourself. Listen to individual chords in the music. If you were five, what would the chords, harmonic sequences and rhythm make you do? What is your instinctive response? Is it a peeking-out-from-behind-the-door chord, a scary chord, a surprising one? Does it make you slow down, speed up, mope in a chair? Which animal would you be to this music? Take the response to its adult conclusion. Out of this comes the kernel of what you will refine and use. Your instinct is great - use it!</p>
<p>This is an excellent exercise for finding transitions and for discovering the exaggerations, as in Dorabella&#39;s aria from <em>Così Fan Tutte</em>. It gives you what&#39;s intrinsic in the <em>music</em>. As another example, if you played part of Cherubino&#39;s aria for a five-year -old, the child would dance, skip, jump, giggle, laugh. What would a five-year-old do with the &quot;Maledizione&quot; theme of <em>Rigoletto</em>? Be frightened. You can find your way so easily and so honestly into the character of the music by using your musically sensitive, unencumbered, emotionally responsive five-year-old self.</p>
<h3>Melody</h3>
<p>Melody is the easiest thing to learn by ear, unfortunately. You say, Yes, sure, I know how Mimi&#39;s aria goes or how &quot;La donna é mobile&quot; goes. Do I know that&#39;s an augmented fourth? What augmented fourth? Do i know what note it is? Is it an E, F, G? Why? Does it make any difference? Yes! Whether it&#39;s a  B or B flat makes a <em>big</em> difference to a singer.</p>
<p>I once played <em>I Vespri Siciliani</em> for a famous singer who stopped, looked at the keyboard and asked me why I was playing a high C sharp under the cadenza. I said, &quot;Because it is C sharp.&quot; She said, &quot;It can&#39;t be. I can&#39;t sing that note.&quot; Well, she&#39;d been singing it for the past ten minutes or more. So maybe sometimes it&#39;s better not to know. But knowing what pitch you&#39;re on and what key you&#39;re in, 99 percent of the time, is a very good idea. It&#39;s not a detriment to good singing. And knowing what it looks like instead of what it sounds like can be very helpful. Look at it first, before your voice gets in there. Your voice is expensive. Save it. Listen to the aria a few times. Let your brain and your vocal technique and your ear absorb what these pitches are before you sing them. Don&#39;t just do something over again. Think first. Think very carefully. Replay it, just like the athletes do. And whatever you do, bring your belongings with you when you go to a new piece. Take what you&#39;ve learned previously. You&#39;ll find it helps.</p>
<p>The exact opposite, however, is true for <em>relearning</em> a piece. In that case, if you put an aria away for long enough, some of the mistakes will be forgotten. Listen to new versions of it, new singers and new interpretations. Then it&#39;s a little easier to relearn.</p>
<h3>Dynamics and Embellishments</h3>
<p>Each piece of music has its own momentum. You can&#39;t stop to check and criticize yourself, or the momentum will be lost. Sing with conviction.  Sing it as if you&#39;re right, whether you are or not. There must be a reason for each fermata, each crescendo, each diminuendo.  Make your choices and commit yourself to them. Rests in music aren&#39;t for resting. You can use rests to such an advantage. They can be where atmosphere is created or only the invisible seams that connect emotion to emotion. Give emotional meaning to dynamic markings. <em>Forte</em> can mean big, strong, juicy, voluptuous, exciting, explosive, glorious. <em>Piano</em> can mean calm, careful, whispering, or - in mid-range - not pushing or taking away sound. It doesn&#39;t, on the other hand, indicate undersinging or using a weak or threadbare tone. </p>
<p>&quot;Appoggiatura&quot; comes from the verb <em>appoggiare</em>, to lean. Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti are among the many composers that stylistically require the use of appoggiaturas. They are used to make the recitative line more melodic and will, therefore, show many different emotional facets: weakness, vulnerability, strength or charm.</p>
<p>Appoggiaturas are highly personal in their use. At first, it&#39;s best to learn your recitatives without many appoggiaturas, and then later, add the ones you think are appropriate, always being ready to change for the conductor. The one thing that is for sure is that each conductor with whom you work will want something different with regard to appoggiaturas. Ultimately, the text is the best guide. </p>
<p>Appoggiaturas are a wonderful subject for an entire book. There are many many great singer and conductors of tradition that you can listen to and whose example you can follow. However, appoggiaturas are a source of much debate and discussion, and in this book, I can only make you aware of them. I suggest that you read some of the new books and articles that have resulted from the excellent research being done on the classical and bel canto periods of music.</p>
<p>&quot;Portamento&quot; is an important stylistic device in Italian music, often abused, but very important to be done correctly, with good support and with good energy. Listen carefully to signers who use their portamenti very well and don&#39;t merely slide from one note to another or scoop. (Sliding, scooping and portamento are not all the same thing.) A portamento requires the same energy with which you <em>lift</em> a priceless Ming vase. You can use a portamento when it helps the voice technically, or when two notes are connected with the same vowel, or when marked, or when tradition says you use them. Most conductors prefer that we almost never use portamenti in Mozart. Portamento in bel canto is usually late, fast and light. There are several interesting articles by Will Crutchfield on musical practices, especially on portamenti. William Ashbrook&#39;s book on Donizetti is also an excellent study tool.</p>
<p>Puccini requires the right kind of portamento and is almost always indicated in the music. French music requires very few. The French are much more indicative than the Italians in their manuscripts. When the French want a rest, they put in a rest, and when they want a portamento, they write in: <em>avec portamento</em>. Notice all the clear directions that Massenet wrote his music; follow them. Donizetti wrote his music with very few directions. However, these can be learned from the singers from whom we have inherited a clear indication of style; they are recorded. </p>
<p>A composer&#39;s individual way of writing is particularly fascinating. When you&#39;ve studied a great deal of a particular composer&#39;s work, you begin to understand the way he writes and the way he uses or doesn&#39;t use written indications. You come to see where your freedom is and where you are constrained to follow the music as it&#39;s written. Puccini and Massenet write many directions, Verdi some, but we interpret from his tempi and rhythmical markings what his intentions were. Read the stage directions that are in the scores as well. They are a part of the emotional ambiance and the composer&#39;s idea of the character. This, in turn, can give us a wealth of information in terms of how strict, how tense, how loose, how free the rhythms and dynamic levels should be.</p>
<h3>Performance Practices</h3>
<p>Performance practice is a very interesting way of learning how fashions, ideas and tastes in music change. Find a recording from the 1940s, and listen to the musical values, the language values, the portamenti and the rests used and not used. Follow that same opera through recordings up to the 1990s. See how our idea of musical interpretation has changed. You&#39;ll see that there have been periods of time when opera was more purist, when there was less use of the traditions and closer adherence to the composer&#39;s writing, when there was more emphasis on interpretation, on voice, on musical correctness or on the drama.</p>
<p>It&#39;s wise to have an idea of what the performance practices are in your time, rather than discussing the right and wrong of what has been, what this conductor does or what that singer has done. It&#39;s important to know what we are trying to structure in music and what we hope to achieve with that structure. So as you will hear, portamenti in bel canto and in Mozart, as examples, will change frequently between the &#39;50s, the &#39;60s and the &#39;70s. Take all the best information from all the great singers and conductors, and use it to your best advantage, always considering the time frame which you are in presently.</p>
<h3>Phrasing</h3>
<p>Phrasing in music is a very delicate process, something we tend not to think about in the first years of making beautiful sounds. But it&#39;s important to take an active interest in the phrasing of music. Listen to instrumentalists and how they phrase as well. The work done by violinists and wind instrumentalists can be inspiring and instructive in understanding classical and romantic phrasing. The continuity and shape of another singer&#39;s phrasing can also be an enlightening source of study. Language, music and style have so much to do with the kind of elegant phrasing that we are continuously searching for. As you listen to music, be aware of not only the composer&#39;s style of phrasing, but of each singer&#39;s. Fortunately, there is a wealth of wonderful singing to be heard: Placido Domingo&#39;s gorgeous phrasing of Italian music; Renata Scotto, with her brilliant combination of musical and textual phrasing with dramatic intensity; Montserrat Caballe and her exquisite bel canto phrasing; Carol Vaness&#39;s expert phrasing of Mozart.</p>
<p>Flexibility is crucial within phrasing, because singing is a very flexible process. Some days your body needs more breath than others. When singers go to Mexico or out West, they find themselves breathing more often, because there is less oxygen. When they go to Barcelona, they have so much breath they&#39;re drowning. So that&#39;s important to keep in mind. Don&#39;t impose intellectual judgements on your non-intellectual body. We don&#39;t do music exactly the same every day. Leave room to adjust musically.</p>
<p>A baritone friend of mine recently sang for Pavarroti, who, after listening, asked him to phrase something differently. After years of classes, this young baritone didn&#39;t stop to think, Why, what does he mean? He just did exactly what Luciano wanted. Later he understood why. If a singer can, in an audition with a conductor or another singer, demonstrate this kind of flexibility, it&#39;s wonderful. This baritone was then able to ask, Was my phrasing too choppy? This question enabled Luciano to speak with him in more detail about phrasing. That process is not only good for auditions, but is also useful when working with a conductor or manager.</p>
<h3>Coloratura and Cadenzas</h3>
<p>Most people can learn to sing coloratura passages. It just takes time and patience. The first thing to determine is, How good is your coloratura? Sometimes, you can just do it; some people have a faster voice than others. It doesn&#39;t always have to do with size; it sometimes has to do with mismanaged weight. A voice is never really weightless. You don&#39;t weigh less when you walk lightly, but you do balance differently.</p>
<p>For the hard vocalises, such as the one in &quot;Sempre libera&quot; in <em>La Traviata</em>, the singers I have heard do these best go through them applying all the technique they have learned - what you have to open, close, support, lift, balance, according to your technical range and skill at the moment.</p>
<p>Rhythm is a very big aid in learning to process cadenzas and difficult coloratura. The two problems seem to be where and how to find the articulation, and where and how to find the rhythm. The way I hear people working, and find makes some sense, is first to find the accents, the rhythm, with a metronome if necessary. Put a vamp bass underneath if it helps you. Sometimes, it&#39;s helpful just to walk around while you&#39;re practicing. It keeps your body from being too stiff. Walk, do your scales.</p>
<p>There are many good exercise books that encompass chromatic scales, jumps, long scales, different keys, different vowels, different patterns. You can also take your cadenzas and make vocalises out of them. Before you start out on a piece of music that has coloratura, excerpt the coloratura and study it technically first.</p>
<p>After grasping the rhythmical patterns, the next step is to get the pitches very clean in your mind. Sometimes I hear singers using to very good advantage an articulation device, such as an &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m,&quot; something that will separate one note from another. The articulation device can be one for each note - na-na-na-na-na - then two together - na-a, na-a - then three together, etc. Varying ways to putting those notes back and forth seem to really loosen up the mind and body: short-long-long, short-long-short-long, and so on.</p>
<p>Another device that will sometimes help your voice bounce a little is to do the coloratura in a staccato manner. Listen to any Queen of the Night and you&#39;ll understand in a second how exposed pitches are when staccato. Your ear has to carry you into the pitch, so you have to know <em>exactly</em> what it is. In the staccato, don&#39;t go too fast at first. Line up the pitches very clearly and hear them carefully, because the intervals are sometimes awkward. It can be four whole steps and one half, two half-steps and one whole. That kind of coloratura singing is like being a sharpshooter - it&#39;s either 100 percent right or 100 percent wrong. You have to know where to aim.</p>
<p>I find that short, frequent periods of practice - five to fifteen minutes every hour, particularly for this type of work - are sensational. Gradually, increase the rhythms, and if they&#39;re not steady, use the metronome. Pieces that are really difficult to sing, like the Queen of the Night, can really benefit from mental imaging and hearing yourself sing it, and then actually doing it. Think, then do, rather than do, do, do. And work with your teachers on getting the breath and body buoyant, so you don&#39;t feel locked up or locked in.</p>
<p>It&#39;s helpful to know where your voice moves the fastest. That enables you choose the kind of music with which you want to show off and the kind you want o grow into. Some voices will work faster in the middle, some in the top. If you&#39;re going to sing Semiramide, it&#39;s important to know if you have middle coloratura. Then there&#39;s the high coloratura, like Queen of the Night, or the big lyric roles of Mozart, which have fairly high tessituras. You need to be sure you can sustain that with ease and fluency.</p>
<h3>Recitatives</h3>
<p>Recitatives are the subject of entire classes, so obviously all that is involved in them can&#39;t be encompassed in part of a chapter! Recitatives have to be treated stylistically. Silly as it sounds, it&#39;s imperative to look at whose name is in the upper right corner before you study a recitative. Mozart recitatives, Bellini recitative, Donizetti recitative, Verdi recitative - all are in many ways extraordinarily different. One way to help yourself is to listen to recordings of great conductors and great singers, and familiarize yourself with the <em>sound</em> of different kinds of recitative. It&#39;s also very good to study the recitatives of modern composers such as Britten and Menotti, in order to study recitatives in one&#39;s own language. This can help you deal with recitatives in other languages.</p>
<p>The second thing is to recognize that recitatives come from the word <em>recitare</em>, &quot;to recite.&quot; The major emphasis shifts to what&#39;s being <em>said</em> rather than sung. Any attempt to do a recitative without the most intimate knowledge of the words will be disastrous. </p>
<p>The next big division comes between the <em>secco</em> recitatives (with harpsichord, or harpsichord and cello, that is, without much underneath the singer) and the <em>accompaniato</em> recitatives. The fewer instruments accompanying the recitative, the more freely the recitative can be treated. The <em>secco</em> recitatives are the ones most closely related to what&#39;s happening on the stage - they are Mozart and Rossini recitatives, by and large. These <em>secco</em> recitatives are inevitably in 4/4 time. We should understand that human beings do not speak in 4/4 time; however, the written rhythms are as close to speech as the composer could get them. </p>
<p>Find a group of singers interested in doing recitative. Examine the opera in terms of who speaks faster and who speaks slower. This will differ with each person&#39;s opinion of the character. If we&#39;re discussing <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, perhaps we see Figaro as the fastest-speaking and Bartolo as the slowest. There&#39;s room for lots of opinions. Once you establish a basic speech speed, vary that. Use lots of rubato. Go faster and slower to change the speech pattern inside a particularly long section. Be sure that your cues are always picked up quickly from the person singing before you, unless you purposely want to make a &quot;stage wait.&quot; Otherwise, we need to move the recitatives along. By that, I don&#39;t mean go quickly. I mean, use varying speeds, by all means, but don&#39;t leave big spaces before and after your line.</p>
<p>Read recitatives in the original language, and then in your own language. Work them as a dialogue, using your natural instincts to help you move physically. I can&#39;t stress enough the importance of interaction in recitatives. Learning to communicate and react to the other person&#39;s lines is a critical part of learning the style of recitative. More and more, when you&#39;re being considered for an opera with a lot of recitative, recitative is included in your audition. Singers often hear, &quot;Yes, start the aria from the recitative, please.&quot; Your ability to handle this form fluently is essential.</p>
<h3>And Finally ...</h3>
<p>Some of the things that it&#39;s not possible to deal with in a book are, for instance, What is the right style for Gilda? Are these cadenzas right for you, or should you sing it the way it&#39;s written? Should you sing the E flat at the end of &quot;Sempre libera&quot;or as written? There are lots of choices. What is the perfect tempo for &quot;De&#39; miei bollenti spiriti&quot; from <em>La Traviata</em>? To answer these questions, especially if you are a young and relatively inexperienced singer, you have to find a knowledgeable coach in order to learn what the rules are and, at the same time, keep your individuality. When you&#39;re out there on the stage without us, your instinct, brain and training are what must bring you through. But to know the length of time to hold a note, or how dark or bright that note should be, requires the help of ears other than your own.</p>
<p>Our ideas are precious to us, but if they don&#39;t work, we must change them. Don&#39;t be afraid to throw away last year&#39;s ideas. If you don&#39;t know what to do, use your imagination and do the best you can. It will be better than nothing. But don&#39;t accept stereotyped, routine, predictable ideas, especially from yourself. Know how to go about digesting musical information so that it becomes part of you. And don&#39;t forget that ideas come from the simple things: melody, rhythm, harmony.</p>
<h2>Analyze, Don&#39;t Criticize</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the very best things I&#39;ve ever found for a singer to do is to ask him or herself, &quot;What do I really like about my voice, and what do I know about my voice?&quot; It&#39;s a question I&#39;ve asked nine thousand times in my classes, and I have probably twice in my life had a singer come back with an answer like, &quot;My voice has a bright quality,&quot; &quot;My voice is beautiful,&quot; &quot;My voice has a wide range,&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s good about my voice is its flexibility.&quot; Most singers say,  &quot;My acting is ...&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I interrupt, &quot;your voice.&quot; &quot;Well, my energy ...&quot; &quot;No. Your voice.&quot;</p>
<p>All young singers want their voices to be thought of as beautiful. They will tell us they want to be thought of as a brilliant actor, a sterling musician, a gorgeous personage. But what they really want is that the people on the other side of the table think their voice is beautiful.</p>
<p>If you can analyze what&#39;s good about your voice and write it down, if you can notice clearly the things that need to be fixed, the things that need to be nourished and polished, you have made an important beginning in understanding your strong points and needs as a singer and artist. A singer has to be able to analyze, to be <em>less critical and more analytical</em>. Reinforce what you do that&#39;s satisfying and write it down. Be a good teacher to yourself! Be positive, be clear, be analytical.</p>
<h3>The Group Setting</h3>
<p>Begin by describing not only your own voice, but also all other voices you hear: the voices of your colleagues, the voices you hear in performances, the voices on recordings. Write down the various vocal qualities, using adjectives. It&#39;s not as easy as it sounds, because it&#39;s not a good-or-bad, yes-or-no questions. All qualities are distinctive, and many qualities are likable and unlikable. Try to describe a voice so that a friend will know exactly which singer you were talking about. It&#39;s a good way of sharpening your ears. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also fun to play &quot;drop the needle,&quot; (or the compact disc, as it may be now) based on the principle that the better your ear is for other singers, the better it becomes in analyzing your own singing. Have somebody make a tape of the same phrase as sung by different singers. Identify them in as brief a time as possible, so that your ear becomes adept at identifying the distinctive qualities and what makes them distinctive. Don&#39;t just use singer who are singing today, but use historical and movie recordings as well. See if you can identify the tenor just from his C during &quot;Che gelida manina&quot; from <em>La Bohème</em>. That&#39;s really fun.</p>
<p>Now come back to your own singing. Ask yourself, What is the strong point of your technique? Is it your breath, the placement, the flexibility? What&#39;s needed? Where are you now? Technique is also not a yes-or-no question.</p>
<p>A group setting is excellent for this type of work. One reason I like to work in a group is because, in that atmosphere, a singer can get an idea of what is so completely and utterly fascinating in opera - opinion. Also, working in a group becomes a good way for a teacher to observe students being observed. The student always working in a room alone does not move easily onto the audition stage.</p>
<p>Group work can provide singers with wonderful reinforcement. It&#39;s very beneficial, as well as enjoyable and a great ego booster. By going around the room and asking everybody exactly what they liked about your performance, without going into long, detailed description, you&#39;ll begin to hear words that provide positive feedback - enthralling, gorgeous high notes, strong low notes, excellent character portrayal - all kinds of interesting qualities that you may not have realized about your own presentation. This process can be very encouraging, and you may even find it useful to do on an informal basis without a teacher present.</p>
<p>However, in other ways, group work can be very difficult. For one thing, it&#39;s scary, especially if you go into it with the attitude, &quot;I could be embarrassed, I could lose face.&quot; A better attitude is, &quot;This is my class. I&#39;ve paid for it. Let&#39;s see what I can go home with. I&#39;m going to shop and take home as much as I can.&quot;</p>
<p>But for some singer, learning about their voice and themselves, unfortunately, sometimes takes away their confidence, when its purpose is to give you more confidence. As I watch the learning process in young singers, I hear a lot of, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t do that right, and I don&#39;t know that.&quot; It sort of whittles you away, instead of making you aware of, &quot;Oh, great, now I know what I don&#39;t have and what I need. I&#39;ll just go out and get some of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Come into a class with questions. &quot;How do I do this?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s wrong here?&quot; &quot;How do I make this better?&quot; We should be very demanding of each other. Figure out what you did and how you did it. Don&#39;t just say something was boring. Say why. Figure out why something was effective or why it wasn&#39;t. <em>Worry less and work harder!</em> I find that, as a whole, young opera singers worry too much and find it difficult to work in enough detail. I, myself, used to  find ways to worry rather than to work. Once you let yourself be carried away by the enthusiasm for learning a new idea, for finding a new way to do something, you will be infused with a refreshing and revitalizing energy. It will become the only way you want to work.</p>
<p>There should be only one aim: to get the voice, the music and the expression to be more than just right - to be terrific. The opera singer has no safety net.</p>
<h3>The Right Questions</h3>
<p>The relationship between you and your voice is, of course, very important. After all, your voice is with you twenty-four hours a day. It&#39;s important that you be a good parent, a good keeper - that you be responsible for this voice. </p>
<p>We all seem to learn better by being challenged, by having the best demanded of us and by rewarding ourselves for our accomplishments. You don&#39;t learn better by being negative. You learn better when the positive action has been reinforced:&quot; The high notes worked pretty well...&quot; &quot;I sang an &#39;ah&#39; vowel once the way my teacher wanted me to...&quot; It&#39;s easier to do the right thing again, when you know it&#39;s the right thing, than to remember not to do the wrong thing. That&#39;s much too complicated.</p>
<p>Singing is a very athletic task. Look at how athletes visualize by seeing their entire performance before they do it. Reinforcement of positive action is very important. Today you did this, this and this well. Make an accurate list of what did work. After you sing, it&#39;s helpful to sit down and make a few notes about what you did that was good, so it&#39;s in your memory and is repeatable.</p>
<p>When your teacher says, This was not good, and this could be better, and the low note wasn&#39;t satisfactory, and the G sharp was flat - well, what was good? We tend, in a kind of medical fashion, only to deal with the areas that are not entirely healthy. Ask the questions that will bring out some of your good points and elicit some much-needed positive feedback.</p>
<p>When a singer asks questions like, What did you like, What did I do well today, What did you particularly like about my voice, Did you like the top better than the bottom, it allows someone to answer in a positive fashion. And from that answer, the singer obtains much-needed information.</p>
<p>When you hear, &quot;Not ready for the Metropolitan Opera,&quot; or &quot;Not ready for management,&quot; this type of answer is very ambiguous, difficult to deal with and certainly does not contribute to a specific learning process. If you&#39;re going to the trouble of preparing for an audition, you should be able to at least learn something. It&#39;s another good reason for group feedback.</p>
<h3>It&#39;s Not What They Say</h3>
<p>Group work is also a good way to learn from the motto of an old game show, &quot;It&#39;s not what you say, it&#39;s what you don&#39;t say.&quot; But whether a singer works in a group or not, it&#39;s important to listen to what you&#39;re told. People are generally not mean. There is a way of understanding what people say, who says it and why they say it, and understanding also what they <em>don&#39;t</em> say.</p>
<p>There are lots of clues in what people don&#39;t say. What&#39;s left out is as important as the comments you actually receive, because, for the most part, no one will say, &quot;You know, your acting was terrible,&quot; &quot;Your voice doesn&#39;t carry,&quot; &quot;Your loud tones wobble.&quot; Instead, the singer will hear, &quot;You made it sound very fragile,&quot; &quot;You were understated,&quot; &quot;Your pianissimos were gorgeous.&quot; But you don&#39;t really hear about the powerful characterization, the voice that soared over the orchestra, the exquisite high notes.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that singers don&#39;t get better faster is that they don&#39;t know how to listen, how to interpret their teachers and their coaches. And they don&#39;t know how to digest and use information that they do get. It&#39;s really very important in the group, audition and career processes to learn to decode what&#39;s being said and what&#39;s being omitted. Has nobody out of twenty people mentioned your high notes after you sang Queen of the Night? Did not one person mention the quality of your voice, even at least as being interesting? Did nobody say anything about your low notes, your acting, your phrasing, your language? What comment was missing?</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve just sung Rosina in <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em> and you&#39;ve been told you&#39;re stunning and stately, that&#39;s fine. But what <em>didn&#39;t</em> they say? They didn&#39;t say you were vivacious, charming and have a lovely, exciting voice, i.e., the qualities usually sought after for a Rosina in a regional house.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve sung an aria, if people talk about your acting and your presentation and how convincing you were, this is great. But what didn&#39;t they say? Nothing about your voice, your suitability for the role, your musicality?
We are fortunate to live in a time when there is access to live performances, to recordings, to videotapes that will help you understand musical tradition, hear the variety of colors and textures and sizes in voices, and understand your own voice and musicality better as a result. With today&#39;s recording technology, there are not as many mistakes left in recordings as there were once upon a time. But don&#39;t forget to listen to the older recordings. Yes, the singers are singing in a different musical tradition than is sometimes being performed today - singers tend to be attached to the singers of their own generation - but there&#39;s an amazing line there, and you hear that line if you listen to Rosa Ponselle, to Eleanor Steber, and many others. Know historically where you&#39;re coming from, absorb what you hear and have the flexibility to learn. And do not judge the great singers on the way they sounded at the end of their careers and write them off as a waste of time! They became famous for a reason. Find out why and learn from these people. It is a waste of time to indulge in musical and vocal snobbery.</p>
<p>Analyze there singers. Who is your favorite and why? And what <em>didn&#39;t</em> you say? When I ask singers in my classes about their own favorites, their comments are fascinating: &quot;I like so and so. I just heard her, and I absolutely couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing. The voice is incredible.&quot; Nothing about the singer&#39;s acting, stage presence, interpretation. (With good reason. That particular singer is not a good actor or interpreter, but possesses a remarkably beautiful voice.) It&#39;s an excellent exercise for discerning your own strong points and what&#39;s being omitted in positive conversation.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get feedback, when people don&#39;t want to tell you what they didn&#39;t like - not until you&#39;re famous, anyway, at which point they tell you only too often - is to ask people simply what they liked in a performance or, if possible, about an audition. After a competition, when you get the notes back, often the judges look as if they&#39;re saying opposite things. But when you look carefully, not really. One judge says, &quot;Pitch insecure.&quot; The other judge says, &quot;Vowels not clear.&quot; Are they really referring to the same thing? If so, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to go home and work on your pitch and your vowels. It means you have to go home and work on the <em>connection</em> between your pitch and your vowels. Find the relationship between what people say, what they mean, and what you should do about it.</p>
<p>Become deft with your questions. &quot;Which did you like better?&quot; is a much stronger question than, &quot;What was wrong with my...&quot; Use manager, conductor and your own sensitivity to deal with &quot;what was good&quot; and &quot;what was better than.&quot; Then you need to deduce, if everybody said you were elegent, sophisticated and warm, that perhaps this is not really Rosina. Maybe you were more the mature Rosina, when she reappears as the Countess in <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>. It&#39;s exciting to see how you can utilize all the comments that are made. They&#39;re an important part of your growth for your whole career.</p>
<h3>Giving and Receiving Information</h3>
<p>None of this analysis is easy. Some of you who are reading this book are probably in that difficult place where you&#39;ve learned how to sing and are just about ready to go out and perform. You&#39;re not yet what you&#39;re going to be, but the work toward becoming a professional has started, so you&#39;re already somewhat of a professional in your own mind. I&#39;ll just say again that the hardest thing a professional singer does, from the Metropolitan Opera to the tiniest studio, is develop the strength of ego and confidence and commitment to go out in front of an audience and be all those things you want to be - a brilliant singer, a vulnerable, dynamic, charismatic actor or actress - only to take a voice lesson and hear, &quot;Now, dear, this wasn&#39;t, and this wasn&#39;t, and this wasn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Lack of defensiveness is important. It allows you to <em>hear</em>. One of the biggest hindrances is a defensive shell that, while it keeps you from being devastated, also makes you angry with people who are trying to help you. It can render you unable to be open enough to work and learn.</p>
<p>It&#39;s difficult, to say the least, to keep alive that vulnerable part of you that loves the music and not be consumed by outside opinion. Simply try to deal with the <em>facts</em>. &quot;Your low notes are really not audible yet&quot; is fact. You can go home and work on this. It&#39;s just like saying, &quot;You didn&#39;t polish the bottom of the piano,&quot; &quot;your high notes are not round enough in the theater,&quot; or &quot;The middle of your voice sounds beautiful, but it doesn&#39;t match either the top or the bottom.&quot; These are not attacks.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#39;s good to turn outside opinions into observations. &quot;I notice that when you sing in the upper range of your voice, it&#39;s much brighter than when you sing in the rest of your voice.&quot; No judgement. People can work together very well, if they only ask for observations from each other and resist the impulse to become teachers themselves. We can be most helpful to each other by saying, &quot;I notice when you sing B, you lift up your left foot,&quot; or &quot;I noticed your body was much quieter this week.&quot;</p>
<p>When you are working in a group or taking your voice lesson or coaching, remember - approval is what you want when you&#39;re in front of an audience. In a class or group, approval is nice to have, but it&#39;s not really the thing for which you paid money or spent time. You can get approval from your mother for free.</p>
